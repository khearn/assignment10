        <p>Here at Random Task, we strive to make your lives a little easier.  We understand that you have a lot going on in your life and at times it can be difficult to remember everything you have to do each day.  That is where we come in.</p>
        <p>Once you create an account you can enter in task or jobs that you have to do.  We will take that information and generate a calendar of your tasks as well as to do lists for each day.  You might be thinking, 'why bother?!  It's exactly the same as carrying around a planner.'  But you would be wrong to think this cause we wont stop there!</p>
        <p>Each day we will send you and email or a text with a list of your to do tasks for that day!  That way you don't have to remember to check your account!</p>
