Trumpeters ready!

Drummers, start drumming!

Down to a world I know



  

                   

There's never been

not ever before



  

                   

A child born

Down to the sea we go

Down to the world below



  

                   

Ajourney to bless a princess-to-be

Under the sun

What's all the big commotion

that's spreading through the ocean



  

                   

From sea to shining sea

comes back here to de water

Ariel's Melody



  

                   

La-da, da-da, di-da-da



  

                   

- La-da, da-da, di-da-da

- La-da, di-da-da

- La-la-la

- La-la, la-la-la



  

                   

Up from the sea we rise

Up to the world of skies



  

                   

There's never been

not ever before



  

                   

A child born

of sea and shore



  

                   

Up from the sea we rise

Up to the world of skies



  

                   

Forever to be

together as one



  

                   

Under the sea

and under the sun



  

                   

This is your world

my darling



  

                   

One world

The land and sea



  

                   

My hope for you

for always



  

                   

Is that your heart

will hold part of me



  

                   

Down to the sea we go



  

                   

- Up from the sea

- Down to the world below



  

                   

Together we come

forever to be



  

                   

Under one sun



  

                   

The land and the sea



  

                   

My precious Melody...



  

                   

I'm giving you this locket...



  

                   

so that you will never forget

that part of your heart...



  

                   

will always belong to the sea.



  

                   

Melody!



  

                   

- A party!

- Ursula's crazy sister!



  

                   

I didn't miss the cake

and ice cream, did I?



  

                   

Morgana!



  

                   

Surrender the baby, or I'll...



  

                   

Ursula would have simply

loved to have come...



  

                   

but something came up.



  

                   

Now-Now, what was it?

Oh, yes.



  

                   

You all shish-kebabbed her!



  

                   

One minute you're on top,

the next you're sushi.



  

                   

Now, is that fair, gramps?

I ask you.



  

                   

But then, whoever said

we had to play fair?



  

                   

Oh, Undertow!



  

                   

Make way, little mershrimp!



  

                   

I'm comin' through!



  

                   

Now hand over the trident,

or your precious granddaughter...



  

                   

will be shark chow!



  

                   

You can have

anything you want.



  

                   

Just don't harm

little Melody.



  

                   

Well, well.



  

                   

I get the trident...



  

                   

avenge poor,

unfortunate Ursula...



  

                   

and gain all the powers

of the ocean!



  

                   

And it's not even   :  .

Not a bad morning.



  

                   

Hit the deck!



  

                   

Melody!



  

                   

What have you done to me?

Look at me!



  

                   

I'm an anchovy!



  

                   

This isn't the end, Triton!

It's just the beginning!



  

                   

After her!



  

                   

You'll never find me,

but I'll find you...



  

                   

and your precious granddaughter!



  

                   

We shall not rest until

that madwoman is vanquished!



  

                   

Find her! Find her!



  

                   

I'm sorry. There is no sign of her.

She's vanished.



  

                   

We'll keep trying. We'll...



  

                   

Sweetie, no.



  

                   

Oh, we've got to keep

Melody away from her.



  

                   

Until Morgana is found,

Melody can't go in the sea.



  

                   

- And neither will I.

- But, Ariel...



  

                   

I'm sorry, Flounder.



  

                   

But if Morgana is anything like Ursula,

she'll never give up.



  

                   

This is the only way.



  

                   

Melody can't know about

merpeople or Atlantica...



   

                   

or even you, Daddy.



   

                   

Very well, Ariel.

You're right.



   

                   

Sebastian,

you will watch over her.



   

                   

Me? Aww!



   

                   

Melody?



   

                   

Melody?



   

                   

Oh, Carlotta,

have you seen Melody?



   

                   

Not since this morning,

Your Majesty.



   

                   

Louis, Melody's not in here,

is she?



   

                   

No, Your Highness,

but her birthday cake is.



   

                   

Twelve petite candles.



   

                   

Whoo-eee! This is gonna be

some kind of shindig.



   

                   

Yes, sir, a real swanky soiree,

as they say.



   

                   

There's just one thing missin':

The guest of honour!



   

                   

"Sebastian, you watch

over her," he said.



   

                   

I'm too old for this!



   

                   

A crab my age should be retired,

getting a tan...



   

                   

playing sea golf...



   

                   

sipping a tuna colada!



   

                   

Not baby-sitting

another teenager.



   

                   

Melody!



   

                   

Hey, Scuttle. Hey, Sebastian.

What's kickin'?



   

                   

Uh, what's kickin'?

Hmm. L-Let me see.



   

                   

Don't rush me.



   

                   

Ha! You know perfectly well

what's kicking!



   

                   

Now, come along.

You gonna be late for the...



   

                   

Sorry, Sebastian.



   

                   

Melody, child, how many times

do I have to tell you?



   

                   

It is expressly forbidden

for you to be swimming...



   

                   

- beyond the safety of the sea wall.

- Beyond the safety of the sea wall.



   

                   

Any such swimmin' is a reckless

disregard of da rules...



   

                   

don't ya know?



   

                   

Stop dat.



   

                   

Oh, Sebastian,

I can't help it.



   

                   

I just love the sea!



   

                   

Hey! Come back here!



   

                   

You're just like...



   

                   

like your mother.



   

                   

Hi, Melody.



   

                   

Trust me!



   

                   

This time I'm sure

I've got it right.



   

                   

Yeah, that's what you said last time,

and I was sore for a week.



   

                   

Oh, stop your carping

and stand still.



   

                   

Oh, this is gonna hurt.



   

                   

Yes! Yes! Yes!



   

                   

Uh-oh.



   

                   

Oh, it's just no use.



   

                   

The power of the trident is just

too strong for me to overcome.



   

                   

I bet Ursula could've done it.



   

                   

What was that you said?



   

                   

Nothin'.

I'm just sayin'...



   

                   

Stop criticizing me!



   

                   

That's all my mother ever did

was criticize me!



   

                   

It was always "Ursula this"

or "Ursula that"...



   

                   

or, "Morgana, why can't you be

more like your sister...



   

                   

Ursula!"



   

                   

Well, it isn't Ursula's fault

I got miniaturized.



   

                   

- It's yours!

- Is not!



   

                   

Your fault that we had to hide out here

for    frostbitten years.



   

                   

- Is not!

- Your fault that we can never show

our faces in polite society again!



   

                   

You're really pushing it,

small fry.



   

                   

- It's the locket!

- It's the locket!



   

                   

This is just the kind of

break in the ice we've been waiting for.



   

                   

When Ariel's

innocent little daughter...



   

                   

uncovers the secret

of that locket...



   

                   

she's going to have

lots of questions.



   

                   

And who'll be right there

with all the answers?



   

                   

- We will.

- Exactly!



   

                   

She'll be the perfect tool

for Triton's undoing.



   

                   

And I'll get to be big again.



   

                   

Finally I'll succeed at

the one thing my sister never could.



   

                   

- Really, really big again!

- Total domination of the seas!



   

                   

I'll be huge!



   

                   

Melody, please.



   

                   

If your mother ever found out

you'd been swimming out here...



   

                   

I know, I know.

She'd flip.



   

                   

I had a thought here.

Now, where'd it go?



   

                   

Hey, Sebastian...



   

                   

what's my mom

got against the ocean anyway?



   

                   

I mean, how could there be

anything wrong with something so...



   

                   

wonderful?



   

                   

You know what?



   

                   

Sometimes I even pretend

I have fins.



   

                   

I wish I could

tell my mom how I feel.



   

                   

But she'd never understand.



   

                   

I can talk to crabs,

but not to her.



   

                   

Wait a minute.



   

                   

It just hit me.



   

                   

How 'bout you tell Ariel...



   

                   

how you really feel?



   

                   

Oh, yes, by all means.



   

                   

Just waltz right in

and tell her you been out here...



   

                   

swimming in the ocean!



   

                   

- We could all just have a big party.

- The party!



   

                   

Say, that reminds me

of somethin'.



   

                   

- Whoa!

- Oh, Your-Your Highness.



   

                   

Sorry. My fault.



   

                   

I gotta go. Can't go to

the party without shoes.



   

                   

If you ask me,

she's a little strange.



   

                   

I heard she actually

talks to fish.



   

                   

It should make for

an interesting party.



   

                   

I miss you, Daddy.



   

                   

I wish you could

be here with us.



   

                   

Mother?

What are you doing?



   

                   

Uh, nothing.



   

                   

L-I'll be right up!



   

                   

Melody?



   

                   

I'm ready.



   

                   

Here. Let me help.



   

                   

So, we're having

a bad hair day.



   

                   

If we were, you wouldn't

be helping, would you?



   

                   

Well, I'm just here to let you know

there are a lot of people downstairs...



   

                   

Oh, we'll be right down.

Give us two minutes.



   

                   

Right, two...

Now where have I heard that before?



   

                   

Mom, put down the brush.

It's hopeless.



   

                   

Oh. You look beautiful.



   

                   

Do I have to do this?



   

                   

Everybody thinks I'm weird.



   

                   

Oh, honey, everyone has trouble

fitting in at your age.



   

                   

I know I did.



   

                   

I was a regular

fish out of water.



   

                   

You? No way.



   

                   

I'm just so afraid I'm gonna

make a total fool of myself.



   

                   

Melody, this isn't

just about the party...



   

                   

is it?



   

                   

Is there something

you want to talk about?



   

                   

You know you can always

tell me anything.



   

                   

Well, okay.



   

                   

I mean, it's kind of crazy

and sort of impossible.



   

                   

Now, don't freak,

but what I dream about...



   

                   

more than anything

in the whole world...



   

                   

How's it coming?

Oh, Melody.



   

                   

Is that you?

You look beautiful.



   

                   

He's right.

Now, we'll talk later.



   

                   

You're going to have a wonderful

time tonight. Trust me.



   

                   

May I present

Her Royal Highness...



   

                   

Princess Melody.



   

                   

Oh, yeah. Mom's right.

I can do this.



   

                   

Um, hi.

Would you like to dance?



   

                   

Go on.



   

                   

Sure. Okay.



   

                   

- Oh, no!

- That's it.



   

                   

I'm booking meself

on a cruise.



   

                   

- I'm so sorry.

- Well, I should say!



   

                   

- Are you okay, Sebastian?

- So.



   

                   

Who is she talking to?



   

                   

She's talking to a crab!



   

                   

You!



   

                   

Saboteur!



   

                   

You're going

in ze bouillabaisse!



   

                   

No, Louis!

You don't wanna do this, man!



   

                   

I'm old!

I'm not tender any more!



   

                   

No!



   

                   

Melody!



   

                   

Death to the crab!



   

                   

Oh, Louis!



   

                   

Oh, sweetheart,

I'm so sorry.



   

                   

- What's wrong with me?

- Oh, nothing's wrong with you.



   

                   

Mom, I'm the princess of disaster.



   

                   

Being a teenager i-is hard,

and, uh...



   

                   

all kids your age feel...



   

                   

a-awkward.



   

                   

- And, um...

- Melody?



   

                   

What is this?

My name's on here.



   

                   

That song.

Where have I heard it?



   

                   

It's Atlantica.



   

                   

With merpeople and everything.



   

                   

Mother, you always said

it was just an old fish tale.



   

                   

Where did you get this?



   

                   

L... I found it.



   

                   

You went over the wall,

didn't you?



   

                   

Actually, I went under it.

I hate that stupid wall.



   

                   

Melody, you know you're

not allowed in the sea.



   

                   

But why? And why does

that necklace have my name on it?



   

                   

- Melody, listen to me.

- You're hiding something from me.



   

                   

Y-You deliberately disobeyed me!

I never want you going out there again!



   

                   

Do you hear me?

It's dangerous in the sea!



   

                   

How would you know?

You've never even been in it!



   

                   

M-Melody, l...



   

                   

Oh, no.



   

                   

Ariel, darling...



   

                   

we knew this day would come.



   

                   

Oh, Eric.



   

                   

You're right. It's time

I trusted her with the truth.



   

                   

Oh, now, child,

it's gonna be okay.



   

                   

You know,

when I was a teenager...



   

                   

you couldn't get me

out of my shell for nothin'.



   

                   

I had this high,

squeaky voice...



   

                   

and these itty-bitty

little pincers.



   

                   

And then one day, boom!



   

                   

I sound like Caruso...



   

                   

and these whoppers pop out!



   

                   

Young lady, just where

do you think you're going?



   

                   

I've gotta figure this out.



   

                   

This necklace means something...



   

                   

and if no one's gonna tell me...



   

                   

I'm gonna find out myself.



   

                   

Melody, please!

You're making a big mistake!



   

                   

Oh, this is delicious.



   

                   

This is divine!



   

                   

Let's go, flatsos.



   

                   

Hurry, Undertow.



   

                   

There's a little girl out there

who needs our help.



   

                   

All right, Sebastian,

you must remain calm.



   

                   

This is not your fault.



   

                   

All you have to do is

go in there and calmly explain...



   

                   

that Melody has run away.



   

                   

No reason to lose your head.



   

                   

Whatever you do...



   

                   

you absitively,

positutely...



   

                   

must not panic.



   

                   

- Melody!

- Melody's gone! Melody's gone!



   

                   

- Melody's gone!

- Sebastian? Well,

what are you doing here?



   

                   

All my fault!

I tried to stop her!



   

                   

I don't deserve to live!



   

                   

Gone? Gone where?



   

                   

Out. Out to the sea.



   

                   

What do you mean?

Where could she be going?



   

                   

To Morgana's.



   

                   

And she can tell me what this locket

means, why it has my name on it?



   

                   

Oh, sure, kid.



   

                   

Morgana's the best.

She'll help ya.



   

                   

Okay. Then let's go.



   

                   

Angel face,

meet the one and only...



   

                   

Morgana.



   

                   

Oh, welcome, my precious.



   

                   

Oh, don't be shy.



   

                   

Come in.

Come in out of the cold.



   

                   

Sit, sit.



   

                   

Put your feet up.



   

                   

Hungry? Afraid all I have

is a cold plate.



   

                   

Smelt-cicle? Kelp chip?

Hush guppy?



   

                   

Uh, no, thank you.



   

                   

I was hoping you could

tell me about this pendant...



   

                   

why it has my name on it.



   

                   

My mother wouldn't tell me.



   

                   

She just doesn't understand.



   

                   

Oh, you're not the only one with

a mother who doesn't understand you.



   

                   

Believe me,

I know just how you feel.



   

                   

Dear child,

did you ever consider...



   

                   

that it has

your name on it...



   

                   

because it has

your destiny in it?



   

                   

Oh, deep down...



   

                   

you know you weren't

meant to be a lowly human.



   

                   

What you are is something...



   

                   

far more enchanting.



   

                   

A mermaid?

But it's not possible.



   

                   

Darling, anything's possible.



   

                   

You can turn me into a mermaid?



   

                   

Piece of fish cake, honey.



   

                   

Lots of luck.



   

                   

Ursula's magic?

Where'd you get that?



   

                   

I've been saving it

for a special occasion.



   

                   

One drop of this and,

bada-bing, bada-boom!



   

                   

You're in fin city! Whee!



   

                   

- Really?

- Come, my darling.



   

                   

Your destiny awaits you.



   

                   

I don't believe it!

I'm a mermaid.



   

                   

Say it loud, say it proud!



   

                   

I'm a mermaid!



   

                   

You had this all along.



   

                   

You coulda changed me back.

Why, I oughta...



   

                   

Keep your scales on,

small fry.



   

                   

I'm still reeling her in.



   

                   

Oh, Daddy, I'm so worried.



   

                   

Everything's going to be

all right, Ariel.



   

                   

We have search parties

scouring the ocean.



   

                   

I'm going to join them now myself.



   

                   

- Ariel, maybe you should go with him.

- But, Eric...



   

                   

I need to stay here

and lead the search on land.



   

                   

But you know these waters...



   

                   

and you know our daughter.



   

                   

- You have to go.

- It may be dangerous.



   

                   

Eric's right, Daddy.



   

                   

I should have known I couldn't keep

Melody from the sea. It's a part of her.



   

                   

And a part of me.

I have to go.



   

                   

Bring her home.



   

                   

What a totally cool feeling!



   

                   

Oh, excuse me.

I'm so sorry, ma'am.



   

                   

Okay, get a grip

Get the hang of this flipper



   

                   

It's like slipping two feet

into one big, huge slipper



   

                   

This way is left

Which way is right



   

                   

Oh, now I'll be circling

in circles all night



   

                   

Oh, so this is forward

No problem



   

                   

I can't believe

I can do this and more



   

                   

To swim in the sea

like I walk on the shore



   

                   

Out of my shell

Not closed up like a clam



   

                   

Look out, sea

This is me



   

                   

Here I am



   

                   

For a moment

all of me



   

                   

Is alive and at home in the sea



   

                   

I'm swirling and twirling

so graceful and grand



   

                   

Not stubbing my toes

Getting stuck in the sand



   

                   

For a moment

life is cool



   

                   

I'm a splash

in the world's biggest pool



   

                   

This is more than my thoughts

ever thought it could be



   

                   

For a moment

Just a moment



   

                   

Lucky me



   

                   

If only for one moment



   

                   

I had shared with you

all I know



   

                   

The sea wouldn't be

a mystery



   

                   

Oh, why did you have to go



   

                   

Everything's newer

and brighter and bluer



   

                   

And truer to life than before



   

                   

Watch me soar



   

                   

For a moment

I can shine



   

                   

Got a grin

and a fin that works fine



   

                   

My fingers are wrinkly

and I really don't care



   

                   

If all of my curls

have curled out of my hair



   

                   

For a moment

I can feel



   

                   

All the dreams

I've been dreaming are real



   

                   

Wish my mother

could hear it



   

                   

The sea is my song



   

                   

For a moment

Just a moment



   

                   

- I belong

- I will find you, my darling



   

                   

And the moment that I do



   

                   

I'll hold you close

my Melody



   

                   

And sing the song of the sea



   

                   

With you



   

                   

- Sing the song of the sea

- For a moment, just a moment



   

                   

- With you

- I belong



   

                   

Oh, thank you!

Thank you so much!



   

                   

Oh!



   

                   

What's the matter?



   

                   

Oh, I knew this would happen.



   

                   

One taste, and you're hooked.



   

                   

Oh, Undertow,

I'm such a failure, such a...



   

                   

Oh, my precious...



   

                   

there wasn't enough potion

for this to be a forever spell.



   

                   

Please.



   

                   

L-I don't want to go back

to being an ordinary girl.



   

                   

Isn't there some way

I can stay a mermaid?



   

                   

Oh, I'm afraid there's

absolutely no possible way.



   

                   

Well, there is one way.



   

                   

No. What am I thinking?

It's far too dangerous.



   

                   

What?

Wh... What's too dangerous?



   

                   

Well, I could make

the spell last longer...



   

                   

if I had my magic trident.



   

                   

Oh, but it was stolen years ago...



   

                   

by a deranged kleptomaniac...



   

                   

and there's no one

to get it back for me.



   

                   

Maybe I could

get it back for you.



   

                   

You would do that for me?



   

                   

If I did, would you

make me a mermaid forever?



   

                   

Even longer, if you like.



   

                   

Now, here is where

the scoundrel lives.



   

                   

Atlantica? You mean

it's not just an old fish tale?



   

                   

- It really exists?

- Of course it exists, dear.



   

                   

Whoever told you otherwise?



   

                   

My mother.



   

                   

Well, I'm sure she didn't mean

to be cruel and deceitful.



   

                   

Okay, I'll bring back

your trident.



   

                   

- You can count on me!

- Be careful, dear.



   

                   

Enjoy those fins!



   

                   

While you can.



   

                   

Hmm, let's see.



   

                   

South to Two Circles Pass...



   

                   

then, uh, north to...



   

                   

No, no, um, east...



   

                   

to, uh, hmm...



   

                   

My map. It's ruined.



   

                   

Now how am I gonna

find my way to Atlantica?



   

                   

Help! Someone, please!



   

                   

Help! Oh! Oh, hold on, sweetie!

We'll save you!



   

                   

Help! Mama!



   

                   

Hurry!



   

                   

I can't reach her!



   

                   

Oh! Oh! Somebody help us!



   

                   

Mightier than a hurricane!

Braver than a killer whale!



   

                   

Faster than a moray eel!



   

                   

- It's the fearless adventurers...

- Slash-explorers.



   

                   

Titanic Tip and

his trusty sidekick Dash!



   

                   

- Oh, no.

- Not them.



   

                   

This is it, Dash.

Redemption.



   

                   

- No, not the walrus.

- Sorry.



   

                   

- Excuse me.

- Ow!



   

                   

Oh, was that your face?



   

                   

We're finally gonna be

heroes for real.



   

                   

Yeah. They're not gonna

laugh at us any more.



   

                   

This is too easy.



   

                   

And a-one, and a-two...



   

                   

and a shark...



   

                   

- Shark?

- Shark!



   

                   

- Goin' up! Goin' up! Goin' up! Goin' up!

- Goin' down.



   

                   

Get off me!



   

                   

Well, that wasn't so bad.



   

                   

Mama!



   

                   

Another plan perfectly executed.



   

                   

What did you think

you were doing?



   

                   

We were just trying to be heroes.



   

                   

You call abandoning my baby heroic?



   

                   

You two boys

almost got us all killed.



   

                   

Oh, yeah,

some fearless heroes.



   

                   

More like zeroes!



   

                   

- Hear that? Zeroes!

- That's a good one!



   

                   

Go ahead.

Laugh your stinkin' tuxedos off.



   

                   

We'll show you... someday.



   

                   

Excuse me.



   

                   

You don't have to be scared of me.

I won't hurt you.



   

                   

Scared? Who said anything

about bein' scared?



   

                   

Don't you know an evasive manoeuvre

when you see one?



   

                   

Hi. I'm Melody.



   

                   

This here's Tip,

and I'm Dash.



   

                   

Excuse me, Mr I Spill My Guts

To Total Strangers.



   

                   

- You just blew our cover!

- I was just trying to be friendly.



   

                   

Uh, guys, I really

need to get going...



   

                   

so if you could

just tell me...



   

                   

See? Now she's gonna leave,

and it's all your fault.



   

                   

- My fault? She's-She's-She's...

- Guys?



   

                   

She's probably

allergic to blubber.



   

                   

Oh, yeah?



   

                   

Well, maybe she doesn't like

birds that can't fly!



   

                   

- Guys.

- Well, you can't fly either.



   

                   

And you walk funny.



   

                   

- Guys!

- Oh, yeah? Well...



   

                   

- You can't fly either!

- Guys!



   

                   

Do either of you know how to get

to Atlantica? I don't have much time.



   

                   

Why do you want

to go to Atlantica?



   

                   

I have to get something

that was stolen from a friend.



   

                   

If I don't,

I'll turn back into...



   

                   

A what?

Turn back into a what?



   

                   

A human.



   

                   

I knew there was something

un-fishy about you.



   

                   

Tough break, sister.

Drop us a line.



   

                   

Let us know how

it all turns out.



   

                   

- We'll take you.

- You will?



   

                   

- We will?

- She's a damsel in distress.



   

                   

It's our big chance.



   

                   

Hoo-boy. I can't believe I'm doin' this.

Somebody stop me.



   

                   

All right, then, we're in.

On to Atlantica!



   

                   

Taming the tides



   

                   

Swarming the seas



   

                   

Beware, barracudas

Drop to your knees



   

                   

Defending our friends

and anemones



   

                   

- As big as a whale

- Hey!



   

                   

With a much smaller tail



   

                   

Facing the foe

with our fearless flukes



   

                   

Daring the dastards

to put up their dukes



   

                   

Great globs of gore

We'll storm the shore



   

                   

And seek the unknown



   

                   

Then can we go home?

with their clammy claws



   

                   

We'll shatter those sharks

with their savagejaws



   

                   

- The battle is fierce

- And mercifully brief



   

                   

The conquering heroes return

as kings of the reef



   

                   

We'll dine with the best



   

                   

Dressed with a flair



   

                   

Climb every mountain



   

                   

Because it's there



   

                   

Come on, follow me

We'll make history

- The trident



   

                   

Or bust

Atlantica



   

                   

Here we come



   

                   

I knew it! It's real!



   

                   

Atlantica.



   

                   

That's right, Princess.



   

                   

Just a little further.



   

                   

Cloak! Dagger!



   

                   

Go make sure that no one interferes

with her return, hmm?



   

                   

Have you heard anything, Daddy?



   

                   

L-I've been searching everywhere,

but I'd... Flounder!



   

                   

Daddy!



   

                   

Now what?



   

                   

- Sorry.

- Ariel?



   

                   

- Flounder?

- Ariel!



   

                   

Oh, I've missed you!



   

                   

Boy, you're sure not

a guppy any more.



   

                   

You can say that again.



   

                   

- Over here!

- Throw it to me!



   

                   

- Yeah!

- I want it!



   

                   

Children, what did I say about playing

"kick the clam" on the reef?



   

                   

- Sorry, Dad.

- Uh, kids.



   

                   

I'm sorry about Melody.



   

                   

Flounder,

I really need your help.



   

                   

Wild sea horses

couldn't stop me.



   

                   

- Oh, boy!

- Follow me!



   

                   

- I'm the leader!

- Come on!



   

                   

It's so beautiful.



   

                   

- Whoa!

- Whoa!



   

                   

- Sorry, my...

- Sorry, my fault.



   

                   

- Fault.

- Hi.



   

                   

I don't think I've seen you around here.

What's your name?



   

                   

I'm Mel... Mel...



   

                   

Hey, guys!

Meet Mel-Mel.



   

                   

- Hi.

- Hey, you wanna hang out with us?



   

                   

All right, all right.

Break it up. Break it up!



   

                   

There's nothing to see here.

Move along.



   

                   

Come on, Miss Popularity.



   

                   

We have a previous engagement.

Remember?



   

                   

Maybe I'll catch you later.



   

                   

This is what happens when you bring

a country fish to the big city.



   

                   

Was that a penguin?



   

                   

Wow!



   

                   

Nice crib.



   

                   

Come on. Follow me.



   

                   

That must be him.



   

                   

He looks sad.



   

                   

- He doesn't look like a thief.

- They never do.



   

                   

Look! There it is!



   

                   

A fork? We're risking

our tails for a fork?



   

                   

We haven't time for this!



   

                   

I want every available

merman searching!



   

                   

Find her!



   

                   

Find her!



   

                   

Dash, if-if this is the end...



   

                   

I just want you to know, pal...



   

                   

I'm sorry I said that thing

about the blubber.



   

                   

Well, I'm sorry

about the fish breath.



   

                   

Yeah. You didn't

say anything about that.



   

                   

But I was thinkin' it.



   

                   

King Triton,

your daughter has returned.



   

                   

Ooh, that was close.



   

                   

Oh, sure, that's it. Take your time.

Kick back. Relax.



   

                   

Let's all just

linger here and die!



   

                   

I'm sure she'll turn up soon.



   

                   

He's coming back!



   

                   

My necklace!



   

                   

Ah, don't worry, Ariel.

We'll find her.



   

                   

Daddy! The trident!



   

                   

But that's not possible.



   

                   

Nobody can remove the trident

from the stand except you, sire.



   

                   

You or one of your descendants.



   

                   

- Melody.

- Who I was supposed to be watching.



   

                   

Go ahead, crack me open.

Make a crab cake out of me, sire.



   

                   

But how could she

have gotten here?



   

                   

Morgana. If she gets

her hands on my trident...



   

                   

Double the search parties!



   

                   

- I want every creature

in the ocean on patrol!

- Yes, sire!



   

                   

Wait a minute.

I know those two.



   

                   

It's all my fault.



   

                   

If I had just paid

a little more attention...



   

                   

instead of blabbering

on and on and on...



   

                   

and on and on.



   

                   

From now on, Your Majesty,

nothing gets past...



   

                   

Me.



   

                   

We did it!



   

                   

All this time...



   

                   

Atlantica was never

that far away from home.



   

                   

This is your home?



   

                   

- It used to be.

- Whoa! What a pad!



   

                   

Talk about your kerb appeal.

But, uh, what's with the wall?



   

                   

I know good fences make good

neighbours, but isn't that a bit much?



   

                   

- Yeah. What you tryin' to keep out?

- It wasn't built to keep something out.



   

                   

It was built to keep me in.



   

                   

Come on. Let's go.



   

                   

You know, kid, the three of us,

we make a pretty good team.



   

                   

Once you're a permanent mermaid,

we'll be friends forever.



   

                   

- We'll be inseparable!

- Nothing will ever come between us.



   

                   

- Shark!

- Run! Run!



   

                   

No, wait!



   

                   

It's just...



   

                   

Leavin' so soon, boys?



   

                   

What can I say?

When you got it, you got it.



   

                   

Hey! You got it!



   

                   

Sweetheart,

you're my new hero.



   

                   

Let's go.

It's time for some magic.



   

                   

But... But my friends...



   

                   

Ha! You mean you call those two

yellow-bellied sea slugs your friends?



   

                   

Come on!

You wanna be a mermaid, or what?



   

                   

We got the power.

We got the power.



   

                   

We got the power!



   

                   

So there it is.



   

                   

Swim back as fast as you can and tell

my father. I'll try to find Melody.



   

                   

Oh, but if that old sea witch

is in there, and then there's

that mean little shark...



   

                   

and then those manta rays come,

a-and then she takes those-those

creepy tentacles...



   

                   

so suction cups stick

to your face, and, and...



   

                   

Uh. Uh-uh. No way you're

goin' in there alone.



   

                   

But, Flounder,

if we both go...



   

                   

who's going to tell Daddy

where Morgana's lair is?



   

                   

Say, what's all the whisperin' about?

Is Melody around here?



   

                   

- Did you find her yet? If she's...

- Scuttle!



   

                   

Get down and be quiet.

Wait a minute.



   

                   

Scuttle can get help.



   

                   

Scuttle, I need you

to pay very close attention.



   

                   

We're doomed.



   

                   

Oh, there you are, darling!



   

                   

Oh, I was so worried about you.

And look!



   

                   

You've brought back my trident.

Clever girl.



   

                   

Give it to her! Give it to her!

Give it to her!



   

                   

- Hey!

- Forgive him, dear.



   

                   

He's got a little size issue.



   

                   

- Now, if you'll just hand over the...

- Melody, don't!



   

                   

- Mom!

- Don't listen to her!



   

                   

- You're a mermaid?

- You're a mermaid?



   

                   

Ariel, how nice of you to come.



   

                   

And you brought Flopper with you.



   

                   

The name's Flounder.



   

                   

"Grrr" yourself, pipsqueak.



   

                   

Get that thing and hit me!



   

                   

One bite,

and he's shrimp toast!



   

                   

Sweetheart,

hand me my trident now.



   

                   

All this time,

and you never told me?



   

                   

Kept the most important secret

in her whole life from her own daughter.



   

                   

Please, give it to me, Melody.



   

                   

No. Hand it to me.



   

                   

- It's for your own good.

- She's lying!



   

                   

I've given you

what you've always wanted.



   

                   

She's the one who lied to you

all these years.



   

                   

- I was trying to protect you.

- By fencing me in?



   

                   

You knew how much

I loved the sea.



   

                   

Why did you

keep the truth from me?



   

                   

Melody, listen to me.

If there was one thing in my life

that I could do over, l...



   

                   

- Too late, Mom.

- Melody, no!



   

                   

All the power of the seven seas

at my command!



   

                   

Hello!

Can we get with the programme?



   

                   

It's still

a small world down here!



   

                   

Mom!



   

                   

Your mommy was only trying

to protect you from moi!



   

                   

What she did,

she did out of...



   

                   

Iove.



   

                   

Little Melody's been

a very naughty girl...



   

                   

stealing from

her own grandfather.



   

                   

My... My grandfather?



   

                   

King Triton,

ruler of Atlantica...



   

                   

commander in chief

of all of the oceans!



   

                   

Or at least he was, until

a certain little thief came along.



   

                   

- You tricked me.

- You've got no one to blame

but yourself.



   

                   

Tell me, Melody.



   

                   

Is being a mermaid

everything you dreamed?



   

                   

Was it worth it?



   

                   

Melody!



   

                   

Oh, and by the way...



   

                   

your time as a mermaid

has just about expired.



   

                   

Catch you later.

I've got bigger fish to fry!



   

                   

Bigger fish!

Now, there's an idea!



   

                   

We gotta keep trying.



   

                   

It's no use.

It's too thick.



   

                   

Oh, Flounder.



   

                   

I've ruined everything.



   

                   

We're guppies, man.

Jellyfish.



   

                   

The great Tip and Dash.



   

                   

Cowards-slash-losers.



   

                   

Well, at least we're alive.



   

                   

Yeah, if you wanna

call this living.



   

                   

Okay, on the one hand

we can live a long, healthy life...



   

                   

albeit as disgusting,

pathetic, cowardly...



   

                   

- Worms.

- That's good. Good.



   

                   

Cowardly worms.



   

                   

On the other hand, we could gather

our courage, if we had any...



   

                   

and storm the fortress

and be heroes.



   

                   

Yeah, until they

hack us up into fish bait.



   

                   

You're right.



   

                   

Melody's in there.

She could be in big trouble.



   

                   

She may really need our help!



   

                   

So what's it gonna be?



   

                   

A lifetime as worms...



   

                   

or two minutes as heroes?



   

                   

All hail Queen Morgana!



   

                   

I'm hailin'!

I'm hailin'!



   

                   

Hold on, sweetie!



   

                   

The cavalry is comin'!



   

                   

- Ariel!

- Ah!



   

                   

Prince Eric.

Come to join the party?



   

                   

We're having a blast!



   

                   

Oh, how dear Ursula

would have adored this.



   

                   

Morgana!



   

                   

King Triton?



   

                   

Oh, please!

Is that the best you can do?



   

                   

Release my daughter,

surrender my granddaughter...



   

                   

and I shall spare you.



   

                   

Ooh! What you gonna do?

Throw the crab at me?



   

                   

Face it, Triton.

You're all washed up!



   

                   

Uh-oh!



   

                   

I'm gonna be teachin' you

some manners!



   

                   

Now look at me.

I'm bait!



   

                   

Oh, yeah!



   

                   

Look out!



   

                   

Where's Melody?

What have you done with her?



   

                   

Oh, you want to join

your daughter?



   

                   

Well, I think

that can be arranged.



   

                   

Eric!



   

                   

You are a very bad lady!



   

                   

Very bad.



   

                   

Goin' somewhere, boys?



   

                   

Um, we're just lookin'

for the little penguin's room.



   

                   

Well, it's been nice knowin' ya.



   

                   

Now, that is one brave

hunk of blubber.



   

                   

I'll hold him!

You go find Melody!



   

                   

Hurry!



   

                   

What's... What's happening?



   

                   

Oh, no! Oh!



   

                   

- I thought you were gonna hold him!

- I am holding him!



   

                   

Nice fishy.



   

                   

Ooh. Big fishy.



   

                   

Hold on, Melody!



   

                   

I'm gonna bust us outta here...



   

                   

if it's the last thing I...



   

                   

do.



   

                   

Tip! No! Help!



   

                   

Another plan

perfectly executed.



   

                   

- Melody!

- Uh-oh.



   

                   

Fools!

I have the trident now.



   

                   

And all the creatures of the sea

are in my power!



   

                   

I'm the queen of the sea...



   

                   

and you will

bow down before me!



   

                   

Oh, this can't be good

for the lower back!



   

                   

Pathetic fools!



   

                   

- Watch and see how

utterly powerful I can be!

- Mom!



   

                   

The end begins

for all of you with fins!



   

                   

That's it, Triton.

Bow down!



   

                   

Bow down before me!



   

                   

No, Your Majesty!

You mustn't!



   

                   

I'm sorry, Sebastian.



   

                   

I have no choice.



   

                   

Oh! Wishes do come true.



   

                   

See that, Ma?



   

                   

Who's your favourite now?



   

                   

It's over, Triton!



   

                   

I sentence you to oblivion!



   

                   

You!



   

                   

Just what do you think

you're going to do...



   

                   

with that?



   

                   

Stay back!



   

                   

Wrong end, sweetheart.



   

                   

Grandfather?



   

                   

I think this belongs to you.



   

                   

No!



   

                   

Never again will you or yours

threaten my family!



   

                   

There will be

no escape for you...



   

                   

ever!



   

                   

Mommy.



   

                   

Dad?



   

                   

Oh, Melody,

I was so afraid we'd lost you.



   

                   

- I'm sorry, Mother.

- Oh, no, sweetie.



   

                   

We're sorry.

We should have told you the truth.



   

                   

I didn't mean to hurt anyone.



   

                   

I just hoped I'd be

a better mermaid than a girl.



   

                   

Oh, Melody, sweetie, it doesn't matter

if you have fins or feet.



   

                   

We love you for

who you are on the inside:



   

                   

Our very brave little girl.



   

                   

Just like your mother.



   

                   

Oh, Grandfather!



   

                   

Melody, I don't blame you

for wanting to join us merfolk.



   

                   

And because you're

my granddaughter...



   

                   

I'm giving you

a most precious gift:



   

                   

A choice.



   

                   

You can come to

Atlantica with me...



   

                   

or you can return

to your home on land.



   

                   

It's up to you.



   

                   

I have a better idea.



   

                   

Now we can all be together!



   

                   

I feel the music playin'

It's swingin'and it's swayin'



   

                   

Life is a rhapsody, whoo



   

                   

Today we're so delighted

Today we're all united



   

                   

Here on the land and sea



   

                   

I see the sails are sailing

Even the whales are whaling



   

                   

We're swimmin'fancy free



   

                   

We're feeling better now

We sing together now



   

                   

Here on the land and sea



   

                   

La-dee-da

Pick up the beat



   

                   

Move your fins

and move your feet



   

                   

Life is sweet

Life is grand



   

                   

Blowing bubbles

with the brass bass band



   

                   

Everybody now!



   

                   

Come on in!



   

                   

There's plenty of water

for everyone!



   

                   

- There's no more stormy weather

- Now we can sing together



   

                   

In perfect harmony



   

                   

We're feeling better now

We sing together now

here on the land and sea



   

                   

- Those on land sing

- La-dee-dah-doh



   

                   

- Those below sing

- Lo-dee-doh-doh



   

                   

Life is sweet

As sweet can be



   

                   

On the land and on the sea

Everybody sing



   

                   

Come on, Grimsby, join us.

The water's great!



   

                   

I think not, sir.

The very idea seems rather absur...



   

                   

We're feeling better now

We sing together now



   

                   

Here on the land and sea



   

                   

- Whoa!

- Sorry.



   

                   

- Oh, hi.

- Hi.



   

                   

We're feeling better now

We sing together now



   

                   

Here on the land and sea



   

                   

Look at this stuff

Isn't it neat



   

                   

Wouldn't you think

my collection's complete



   

                   

Wouldn't you think I'm the girl



   

                   

The girl who has everything



   

                   

Look at this trove



   

                   

Treasures untold



   

                   

How many wonders

can one cavern hold



   

                   

Looking around here you'd think



   

                   

Sure, she's got everything



   

                   

I've got gadgets

and gizmos aplenty



   

                   

I've got whozits

and whatzits galore



   

                   

You want thingamabobs

I've got twenty



   

                   

But who cares



   

                   

No big deal



   

                   

I want more



   

                   

I wanna be where the people are



   

                   

I wanna see

Wanna see 'em dancing



   

                   

Walkin'around on those...

What do you call 'em



   

                   

Oh, feet



   

                   

Flippin'your fins

Legs are required

forjumpin', dancin'



   

                   

Strollin'along down the...

What's that word again



   

                   

Street



   

                   

Up where they walk

Up where they run



   

                   

Up where they stay all day

in the sun



   

                   

Wandering free



   

                   

Wish I could be



   

                   

Part of that world



   

                   

What would I give

if I could live



   

                   

Out of these waters



   

                   

What would I pay

to spend a day



   

                   

Warm on the sand



   

                   

Bet ya on land

they understand



   

                   

Bet they don't

reprimand their daughters



   

                   

Bright young women

sick of swimmin'



   

                   

Ready to stand



   

                   

And ready to know

what the people know



   

                   

Ask 'em my questions

and get some answers



   

                   

What's a fire

and why does it...



   

                   

What's the word

Burn



   

                   

When's it my turn



   

                   

Wouldn't I love



   

                   

Love to explore

the shore up above



   

                   

Out of the sea

                 

Wish I could be

Part of that world

2 INT.
BARRACKS--DAY

Marine recruits stand at attention in front of their
bunks.

Master Gunnery Sergeant HARTMAN walks along the
line of blank-faced recruits.

		HARTMAN
	I am Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, your Senior
	Drill Instructor. From now on, you will speak
	only when spoken to, and the first and last
	words out of your filthy sewers will be "Sir!"
	Do you maggots understand that?


		RECRUITS
		(in unison)
	Sir, yes, sir!


		HARTMAN
	Bullshit! I can't hear you. Sound off like you
	got a pair.

		RECRUITS
		(louder)
	Sir, yes, sir!


		HARTMAN
	If you ladies leave my island, if you survive
	recruit training ... you will be a weapon, you
	will be a minister of death, praying for war.
	But until that day you are pukes! You're the
	lowest form of life on Earth. You are not even
	human fucking beings! You are nothing but
	unorganized grabasstic pieces of amphibian
	shit!
	
	Because I am hard, you will not like me. But
	the more you hate me, the more you will
	learn. I am hard, but I am fair!
	There is no racial bigotry here! I do not look down on
	niggers, kikes, wops or greasers. Here you
	are all equally worthless! And my
	orders are to weed out all non-hackers who do not pack
	the gear to serve in my beloved Corps! Do
	you maggots understand that?


RECRUITS
      (in unison)
Sir, yes, sir!



HARTMAN
Bullshit! I can't hear you!


      RECRUITS

(louder)
Sir, yes, sir!

black recruit,

What's your
name, scumbag?

      SNOWBALL
      (shouting)
Sir,
Private Brown, sir!

      HARTMAN
Bullshit! From now on
you're Private
Snowball! Do you like that name?


SNOWBALL
      (shouting)
Sir, yes, sir!


      HARTMAN

Well, there's one thing that you won't like,
Private Snowball! They
don't serve fried
chicken and watermelon on a daily basis in
my
mess hall!

      SNOWBALL
Sir, yes, sir!


      JOKER

(whispering)
Is that you, John Wayne? Is this me?


HARTMAN

Who said that? Who the fuck said that? Who's
the slimy
little communist shit twinkle-toed
cocksucker down here, who just
signed his
own death warrant? Nobody, huh?! The fairy
fucking
godmother said it! Out-fucking-
standing! I will P.T. you all until
you fucking
die! I'll P.T. you until your assholes are
sucking
buttermilk.


Sergeant HARTMAN grabs cowboy by the shirt.



HARTMAN
Was it you, you scroungy little fuck, huh?!


COWBOY
Sir, no, sir!


      HARTMAN
You little piece of
shit! You look like a fucking
worm! I'll bet it was you!


COWBOY
Sir, no, sir!

       JOKER
Sir, I said it, sir!


Sergeant HARTMAN steps up to JOKER.


      HARTMAN
Well ...
no shit. What have we got here, a
fucking comedian? Private Joker? I
admire
your honesty. Hell, I like you. You can come
over to my
house and fuck my sister.

Sergeant HARTMAN purnches JOKER in the
stomach.
JOKER sags to his knees.

      HARTMAN
You little
scumbag! I've got your name! I've
got your ass! You will not laugh!
You will not
cry! You will learn by the numbers. I will
teach
you. Now get up! Get on your feet! You
had best unfuck yourself or I
will unscrew
your head and shit down your neck!

      JOKER

Sir, yes, sir!

      HARTMAN
Private Joker, why did you join
my beloved
Corps?

      JOKER
Sir, to kill, sir!


HARTMAN
So you're a killer!

      JOKER
Sir, yes, sir!


HARTMAN
Let me see your war face!

      JOKER
Sir?


HARTMAN
You've got a war face? Aaaaaaaagh! That's a
war face.
Now let me see your war face!

      JOKER
Aaaaaaaagh!


HARTMAN
Bullshit! You didn't convince me! Let me see
your real
war face!

      JOKER
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!


HARTMAN
You didn't scare me! Work on it!

      JOKER

Sir, yes, sir!

Sergeant HARTMAN speaks into cowboy's face.


HARTMAN
What's your excuse?

      COWBOY
Sir, excuse for
what, sir?

      HARTMAN
I'm asking the fucking questions
here,
Private. Do you understand?!

      COWBOY
Sir,
yes, sir!

      HARTMAN
Well thank you very much! Can I be in
charge
for a while?

      COWBOY
Sir, yes, sir!


HARTMAN
Are you shook up? Are you nervous?

      COWBOY

Sir, I am, sir!

      HARTMAN
Do I make you nervous?


COWBOY
Sir!

      HARTMAN
Sir, what? Were you about to
call me an
asshole?!

      COWBOY
Sir, no, sir!


HARTMAN
How tall are you, Private?

      COWBOY
Sir,
five foot nine, sir!

      HARTMAN
Five foot nine? I didn't
know they stacked shit
that high! You trying to squeeze an inch in
on
me somewhere, huh?

      COWBOY
Sir, no, sir.


HARTMAN
Bullshit! It looks to me like the best part of
you ran
down the crack of your mama's ass
and ended up as a brown stain on
the
mattress! I think you've been cheated!

      HARTMAN

Where in hell are you from anyway, Private?


      COWBOY

Sir, Texas, sir!

      HARTMAN
Holy dogshit! Texas! Only
steers and queers
come from Texas, Private Cowboy! And you

don't look much like a steer to me, so that
kinda narrows it down!
Do you suck dicks!

      COWBOY
Sir, no, sir!


HARTMAN
Are you a peter-puffer?

      COWBOY
Sir, no,
sir!

      HARTMAN
I'll bet you're the kind of guy that would
fuck
a person in the ass and not even have the
goddam common
courtesy to give him a reach-
around! I'll be watching you!


Sergeant HARTMAN walks down the line to another
recruit, a tall,
overtweight boy.

      HARTMAN
Did your parents have any
children that lived?


      PYLE
Sir, yes, sir!


HARTMAN
I'll bet they regret that! You're so ugly you
could be
a modern art masterpiece! What's
your name, fatbody?


PYLE
Sir, Leonard Lawrence, sir!

      HARTMAN
Lawrence?
Lawrence, what, of Arabia?

      PYLE
Sir, no, sir!


HARTMAN
That name sounds like royalty! Are you
royalty?


PYLE
Sir, no, sir!

      HARTMAN
Do you suck dicks?



PYLE
Sir, no, sir!

      HARTMAN
Bullshit! I'll bet you
could suck a golf ball
through a garden hose!

      PYLE

Sir, no, sir!

      HARTMAN
I don't like the name Lawrence!
Only faggots
and sailors are called Lawrence! From now on

you're Gomer Pyle!

      PYLE
Sir, yes, sir!

PYLE has the
trace of a strange smile on his face.

      HARTMAN
Do you
think I'm cute, Private Pyle? Do you
think I'm funny?


PYLE
Sir, no, sir!

      HARTMAN
Then wipe that
disgusting grin off your face!

      PYLE
Sir, yes, sir!


HARTMAN
Well, any fucking time, sweetheart!

      PYLE

Sir, I'm trying, sir.

      HARTMAN
Private Pyle, I'm gonna
give you three
seconds--excactly three fucking seconds--to
wipe
that stupid-looking grin off your face, or
I will gouge out your
eyeballs and skull-fuck
you! One! Two! Three!

PYLE purses his
lips but continues to smile
involuntarily.

      PYLE
Sir,
I can't help it, sir!

      HARTMAN
Bullshit! Get on your
knees, scumbag!

PYLE gets down on his FEnees.

      HARTMAN

Now choke yourself!

PYLE places his hands around his throat as if to

choke himself.

      HARTMAN
Goddamn it, with my hand,
numbnuts!!

PYLE reaches for HARTMAN's hand. HARTMAN jerks
it away.


HARTMAN
Don't pull my fucking hand over there! I said
choke
yourself! Now lean forward and choke
yourself!

PYLE leans forward
so that his neck rests in
HARTMAN's open hand.

HARTMAN chokes PYLE.


PYLE gags and starts to turn red in the face.

      HARTMAN

Are you through grinning?

      PYLE
      (barely able to
speak)
Sir, yes, sir!

      HARTMAN
Bullshit! I can't
hear you!

      PYLE
      (gasping)
Sir, yes, sir!


HARTMAN
Bullshit! I still can't hear you! Sound offlike

a pair!

      PYLE
      (gagging)
Sir, yes, sir!


HARTMAN
That's enough! Get on your feet!

HARTMAN releases PYLE's
throat. PYLE gets to his feet,
breathing heavily.

      HARTMAN

Private Pyle, you had best square your ass
away and start shitting
me Tiffany cuff links
... or I will definitely fuck you up!


PYLE
Sir, yes, sir!

this one is mine. My rifle is my best friend. It

is my life. I must master it, as I must master
my life.


Without me my rifle is useless. Without my
rifle, I am useless. I
must fire my rifle true. I
must shoot straighter than my enemy who
is

trying to kill me. I must shoot him before he
shoots me. I
will.

Before God I swear this creed. My rifle and
myself are
defenders of my country. We are
the masters of our enemy. We are the
saviours
of my life. So be it .. . until there is no enemy
...
but peace. Amen.

HARTMAN
As soon as you finish your bunks, I want you

Private Joker, do

Mary?

HARTMAN throws down the garbage can with a loud
bang.


HARTMAN
Private Joker, I don't believe I heard you
correctly!


JOKER
Sir, the private said "No, sir," sir!

      HARTMAN

Why, you little maggot! You make me want to
vomit!

HARTMAN slaps
JOKER, hard, across the cheek.

      HARTMAN
You goddam
communist heathen, you had best
sound off that you love the Virgin
Mary . . . or
I'm gonna stomp your guts out! Now you do
love
the Virgin Mary, don't you?!

      JOKER
Sir, negative,

      HARTMAN
Private Joker, are you trying to offend
me?!

      JOKER

Targets are raised and lowered, red markers

addresses the recruits.

      HARTMAN
The deadliest weapon in
the world is a ma-
rine and his rifle. It is your killer instinct

which must be harnessed if you expect to sur-
vive in combat. Your
rifle is only a tool. It is
a hard heart that kills. If your killer
instincts
are not clean and strong you will hesitate at
the
moment of truth. You will not kill. You

will become dead marines.
And then you will
be in a world of shit. Because marines are not

allowed to die without permission! Do you
maggots understand?

INT. BARRACKS--NIGHT

The recruits in their skivvies stand at attention
in
two facing rows on top of their footlockers, arms
outstretched,
hands held rigidly in front of them,
palms down, for inspection.


HARTMAN moves along the row of men. He smacks
a recruit's hand.


HARTMAN
Trim 'em.

HARTMAN points at the feet of another recruit.


HARTMAN
Toejam!

To another recruit.

      HARTMAN

Pop that blister!

HARTMAN stops in front of PYLE and notices his foot-

locker is unlocked. He picks up the lock and holds it
up to PYLE.


HARTMAN
Jesus H. Christ! Private Pyle, why is your
footlocker
unlocked?

      PYLE
Sir, I don't know, sir!


HARTMAN
Private Pyle, if there is one thing in this
world that
I hate, it is an unlocked footlocker!
You know that, don't you?


PYLE
Sir, yes, sir!

      HARTMAN
If it wasn't for
dickheads like you, there
wouldn't be any thievery in this world,
would
there?

      PYLE
Sir, no, sir!


HARTMAN
Get down!

PYLE steps down, from the footlocker. HARTMAN
flips
open the lid with a bang and begins rummaging
through the box.


HARTMAN
Well, now .. . let's just see if there's anything

missing!

HARTMAN freezes. He reaches down and slowly picks
up a
jelly doughnut, holding it in disgust at arm's
length with his
fingertips.

      HARTMAN
Holy Jesus! What is that? What is
that,
Private Pyle?!

      PYLE
Sir, a jelly doughnut,
sir!

      HARTMAN
A jelly doughnut?!

      PYLE

Sir, yes, sir!

      HARTMAN
How did it get here?


PYLE
Sir, I took it from the mess hall, sir!

      HARTMAN

Is chow allowed in the barracks, Private Pyle?

      PYLE

Sir, no, sir!

      HARTMAN
Are you allowed to eat jelly
doughnuts,
Private Pyle?

      PYLE
Sir, no, sir!


HARTMAN
And why not, Private Pyle?

      PYLE
Sir,
because I'm too heavy, sir!

      HARTMAN
Because you are a
disgusting fatbody, Private
Pyle!

      PYLE
Sir, yes,
sir!

      HARTMAN
Then why did you hide a jelly doughnut in

your footlocker, Private Pyle?

      PYLE
Sir, because I was
hungry, sir!

      HARTMAN
Because you were hungry?


Holding out the jelly doughnut, HARTMAN walks
down the row of recruits
still standing with their
arms outstretched.

      HARTMAN

Private Pyle has dishonored himself and
dishonored the platoon! I
have tried to help
him, but I have failed! I have failed because

you have not helped me! You people have not
given Private Pyle the
proper motivation!
So, from now on, whenever Private Pyle
fucks
up, I will not punish him, I will punish
all of you! And the way I
see it, ladies, you
owe me for one jelly doughnut! Now, get on

your faces!

      HARTMAN
      (to PYLE)
Open your

He shoves the jelly doughnut into PYLE's mouth.


HARTMAN
They're paying for it, you eat it!

HARTMAN turns to the
recruits.

      HARTMAN

The platoon

FADE TO BLACK


32 INT. BARRACKS--NIGHT

We see a towel on a bed. A bar
of soap is tossed
on the towel. The towel is folded over the soap

forming a weapon.

A hand picks up the towel-weapon and bangs it
on
the mattress making a dull thud.

PYLE is asleep in his bunk.

The
platoon silently slip out of their beds and
form up around PYLE.

A
blanket is thrown over PYLE, each corner held
down by a recruit,
pinning PYLE to the bed.

COWBOY shoves a gag in PYLE's mouth.

PYLE
is helpless.

The platoon files past beating PYLE with the bars
of
soap wrapped in towels.

PYLE's screams are muffled by the gag.


JOKER is the last one. He stands back from the bed.

      COWBOY

(to JOKER)
Do it! Do it!

JOKER hesitates, then moves forward and
hits
PYLE hard several times.

Then JOKER jumps into his bunk.

The
recruits yank the restraining blanket of PYLE
and run back to their
bunks.

      COWBOY
      (removing gag)
Remember, it's
just a bad dream, fatboy.

PYLE sobs loudly and sits up, holding
himself in
pain.

Lying in, his bunk, JOKER covers his ears.

COWBOY raises his hand.

      HARTMAN

Private Cowboy?

      COWBOY
Sir, he was that guy who shot
all those people
from that tower in Austin, Texas, sir!


HARTMAN
That's affirmative. Charles Whitman killed
twenty
people from a twenty-eight-storey
observation tower at the
University of Texas
from distances up to four hundred yards.


HARTMAN looks around.

      HARTMAN
Anybody know who Lee
Harvey Oswald was?

Almost everybody raises his hand.


HARTMAN
Private Snowball?

      SNOWBALL

That's right, and do you know how

Sir, it was pretty far!
From that book
suppository building, sir!

The recruits laugh at
"suppository. "

      HARTMAN
All right, knock it off! Two
hundred and fifty
feet! He was two hundred and fifty feet away

and shooting at a moving target. Oswald got
off three rounds with an
old Italian bolt action
rifle in only six seconds and scored two
hits,
including a head shot! Do any of you people

know where
these individuals learned to
shoot?

JOKER raises his hand.


HARTMAN
Private Joker?

Sir, in the Marines,

Private Pyle out of his bunk after
lights out?! Why is Private Pyle
holding that
weapon? Why aren't you stomping Private
Pyle's
guts out?

      JOKER
Sir, it is the private's duty to inform
the
Senior Drill Instructor that Private Pyie has a
full
magazine and has locked and loaded, sir!

HARTMAN and PYLE look at each
other. PYLE Smiles
from the depths of his own hell.

HARTMAN focuses
all of his considerable powers of
intimidation, into his best John-
Wayne-on-Suribachi
voice.

      HARTMAN
Now you listen to
me, Private Pyle, and,you
listen good. I want that weapon, and I
want it
now! You will place that rifle on the deck at
your feet
and step back away from it.

With a twisted smile on his face pyLE
POintS his
rifle at HARTMAN.

HARTMAN look suddenly calm. His eyes,
his manner
are those of a wanderer who has found his home.


HARTMAN
What is your major malfunction, numbnuts?!!
Didn't
Mommy and Daddy show you enough
attention when you were a child?!!!


BANG!

The round hits HARTMAN in the chest.

He falls back dead.


JOKER and PYLE stand looking at the body.

Then PYLE looks at JoKER and
slowly raises his rifle.

      JOKER
       (trembling)

Easy, Leonard. Go easy, man.

PYLE breathes heavily, and Keeps the
rifle aimed at
JOKER.

JOKER is scared shitless.

PYLE looks at
JOKER for several seconds and slowly
lowers the rifle. Then he stumbles
back a few steps
and sits down, heavily on the toilet.

PYLE turns
away from JOKER and stares into space,
a strangely peaceful look
transforming his face.

He places the muzzle of the rifle in his mouth.


JOKER
No!!!

BANG!

PYLE pulls the trigger and blows the back of
his
head over the white tiled wall behind him.


SCENE FADES TO BLACK


FADE IN:


51 EXT. DA NANG STREET, VIETNAM--DAY

Motorcycles, cars,
Vietnamese civilians. Swinging
her hips ruith exaggerated sexiness, an
attractive
HOOKER in a mini-skirt walks toward a cafe' table
on the
pavement ulhere JOKER and RAFTERMAN are
seated.

Music: Nancy
Sinatra's "These Boots Are Made
for Walking."

The girl stops at
JOKER's table.

      HOOKER
Hey, baby, you got girlfriend
Vietnam?

      JOKER
Not just this minute.


HOOKER
Well, baby, me so horny. Me so horny. Me
love you long
time. You party?

      JOKER
Yeah, we might party. How much?


HOOKER
Fifteen dolla.

      JOKER
Fifteen dollars for
both of us?

      HOOKER
No. Each you fifteen dolla. Me love
you long

      JOKER
Fifteen dollar
too boo-coo. Five dollars each.

      HOOKER
Me

      JOKER
Five dollars
is all my mom allows me to
spend.

      HOOKER
Okay! Ten
dolla each.

      JOKER
What do we get for ten dollars?


HOOKER
Everything you want.

      JOKER
Everything?


HOOKER
Everything.

      JOKER
Well, old buddy, feel
like spending some of
your hard-earned money?

      RAFTERMAN

Just a minute.

RAFTERMAN raises his Nikon and starts
photographing
JOKER and the HOOKER.

The girl strikes quick poses for the camera and

coughs.

JOKER puts his arm around her.

      JOKER
You
know, half these gook whores are serving
officers in the Viet Cong.


The girl coughs again.

      JOKER
The other half have got
T.B. Make sure you
only fuck the ones that cough.

A young
vietnamese boy walks up behind
RAFTERMAN and grabs the Nikon camera
from his
hands.

The boy runs to an accomplice sitting on a waiting

motorbike and tosses the camera to him. Then in
mockery the BOY
excecutes a few, Bruce Lee moves

JOKER laughs.

JOKER and RAFTERMAN walk down the base street

      JOKER
That little sucker really had some
moves on
him, didn't he?

      RAFTERMAN
Yeah ... You
know what really pisses me off
about these people?


JOKER
What?

      RAFTERMAN
We're supposed to be
helping them and they
shit all over us every chance they get ... I

just can't feature that.

      JOKER
Don't take it too hard,
Rafterman. It's just
business.

      RAFTERMAN
I hate Da
Nang, Joker. I want to go out into
the field. I've been in this
country almost
three months, and all I do is take handshake

shots at awards ceremonies.

      JOKER
You get wasted your
first day in the field and
it'd be my fault.

      RAFTERMAN

A high school girl could do my job. I want to
get out into the shit.
I want to get some
trigger time.

      JOKER
If you get
killed, your mom will find me after
I rotate back to the world and
she'll beat the

INT. SEA-TIGER HUT--DAY

A Quonset hut. An editorial meeting of The Sea

presided over by
LIEUTENANT LOCKHART.

JOKER, RAFTERMAN, and six other marine

correspondens are seated around a large messy
table covered with
cameras, photographs,
newspapers artd magazines.

      LOCKHART

Okay, guys, let's keep it short and sweet
today. Anybody got
anything new?

      JOKER
There's a rumor going around that
the Tet
ceasefire is gonna be cancelled.

      LOCKHART

Rear-echelon paranoia.

      JOKER
A bro in Intelligence says
Charlie might try to
pull off something big during the Tet holiday.


LOCKHART
They say the same thing every year.

      JOKER

There's a lot of talk about it, sir.

      LOCKHART
I
wouldn't lose any sleep over it. The Tet
holiday's like the Fourth
of July, Christmas
and New Year all rolled into one. Every

zipperhead in Nam, North and South, will be
banging gongs, barking
at the moon and
visiting his dead relatives.

      LOCKHART

All right ...Ann-Margret and entourage are
due here next week. I
want someone to be
there on the airfield and stick with her for a

couple of days. Uh, Rafterman, you take it.

      RAFTERMAN

Aye-aye, sir.

      LOCKHART
Get me some good low-angle
stuff. Don't make
it too obvious, but I want to see fur and early

morning dew.

      RAFTERMAN
Yes, sir.

      LOCKHART

(reading)
"Diplomats in Dungarees--Marine engineers
lend a
helping hand rebuilding Dong Phuc
villages . . ." Chili, if we move
Vietnamese,
they are evacuees. If they come to us to be

evacuated, they are refugees.

      CHILI
I'll make a note of
it, sir.

      LOCKHART
      (reading)
"N.V.A. Soldier
Deserts After Reading
Pamphlets --A young North Vietnamese Army

regular, who realized his side could not win
the war, deserted from
his unit after reading
Open Arms program pamphlets." That's good,

Dave. But why say North Vietnamese Army
regular? Is there an
irregular? How about
North Vietnamese Army soldier?


DAVE
I'll fix it up, sir.

      LOCKHART
Lawrence Welk
Show's gonna go out on TV in
two weeks. Dave, do a hundred words on
it.
AFTV'll give you some background stuff.

      DAVE

Yes, sir.

      LOCKHART
      (reading)
"Not While
We're Eating--N.V.A. learn
marines on a search and destroy mission
don't
like to be interrupted while eating chow."
Search and
destroy. Uh, we have a new
directive from M.A.F. on this. In the
future, in
place of"search and destroy," substitute the
phrase
"sweep and clear." Got it?

      JOKER
Got it. Very catchy.


LOCKHART
And, Joker ... where's the weenie?

      JOKER

Sir!

      LOCKHART
The Kill, JOKER. The kill. I mean, all
that fire,
the grunts must've hit something.

      JOKER

Didn't see 'em.

      LOCKHART
Joker, I've told you, we run
two basic stories
here. Grunts who give half their pay to buy

gooks toothbrushes and deodorants--Winning
of Hearts and
Minds--okay? And combat
action that results in a kill--Winning the
War.
Now you must have seen blood trails ... drag
marks?


JOKER
It was raining, sir.

      LOCKHART
Well, that's
why God passed the law of
probability. Now rewrite it and give it a
happy
ending--say, uh, one kill. Make it a sapper or
an
officer. Which?

      JOKER
Whichever you say.


LOCKHART
Grunts like reading about dead officers.

      JOKER

Okay, an officer. How about a general?

A few laughs.


LOCKHART
Joker, maybe you'd like our guys to read the
paper and
feel bad. I mean, in case you didn't

know it, this is not a
particularly popular war.
Now, it is our job to report the news that

these why-are-we-here civilian newsmen
ignore.

      JOKER

Sir, maybe you should go out on some ops
yourself. I'm sure you
could find a lot more
blood trails and drag marks.

Some laughs.


LOCKHART
JOKER, I've had my ass in the grass. Can't say
I liked
it much. Lots of bugs and too
dangerous. As it happens, my present
duties
keep me where I belong. In the rear with the
gear.

PAYBACK
Joker's so tough he'd eat the boogers out of a

Listen up, pilgrim. A day without blood is like

Shi-i--i-t! Joker

Some laughs.


PAYBACK
He's never been in the shit. It's hard to talk

      CHILI
Aw, you weren't
on Operation Hastings,
Payback. You weren't even in country.


PAYBACK
Eat shit and die, you fucking Spanish-
American! You
fucking poge! I was there,
man. I was in the shit with the grunts.


JOKER
      (John Wayne voice)
Don't listen to any of
Payback's bullshit,
Rafterman. Sometimes he thinks he's John

Wayne.

      PAYBACK
You listen to Joker, new guy. He knows
ti ti.
Very little. You know he's never been in the
shit,'cause
he ain't got the stare.

      RAFTERMAN
The stare?


PAYBACK
The thousand-yard stare. A marine gets it
after he's
been in the shit for too long. It's like
... it's like you've really
seen beyond. I got it.
All field marines got it. And you'll have it
too.

      RAFTERMAN
I will?

      STORK
Hey,

PAYBACK
Fuck you, Stork.

Oh, shit!

They're outgoing.

      DAVE

That ain't outgoing!

Some closer explosions, much louder.


CHILI
That ain't outgoing!

      DAVE

Cronkite's

In other

Long, serious pause.

How's it gonna look if you get killed wearing

Anyone who runs is a V.C. Anyone who

You

      JOKER

Why should we do a story about you?

RAFTERMAN gags.

Any women or children?

Have you got a body count, sir?

      LT. CLEVES

We think it's twenty.

      JOKER
Do you know how it
happened, sir?

      LT. CLEVES
Well, it seems the N.V.A.
came in with a list
of gook names. Government officials,

policemen, ARVN officers, schoolteachers.
They went around their
houses real polite and
asked them to report the next day for
political
re-education. Everybody who turned up got
shot. Some
they buried alive.

A marine COLONEL who has been watching JOKER

turns from the group arourzd the grave and strides
up. JOKER snaps to

      COLONEL
Marine !

Colonel.

      COLONEL
Marine, what is that button on your

armor?

      JOKER
A peace symbol, sir.


COLONEL
Where'd you get it?

I don't
remember, sir.

      COLONEL
What is that you've got written

helmet?

      JOKER
"Born to Kill," sir.


COLONEL
You write "Born to Kill" on your helmet and
you wear a
peace button. What's that
supposed to be, some kind of sick joke?!


JOKER
No, sir.

      COLONEL
You'd better get your head
and your ass wired
together, or I will take a giant shit on you!


JOKER
Yes, sir.

      COLONEL
Now answer my question or
you'll be standing
tall before the man.

      JOKER
I
think I was trying to suggest something
about the duality of man,
sir.

      COLONEL
The what?

      JOKER
The
duality of man. The Jungian thing, sir.

      COLONEL
Whose
side are you on, son?

      JOKER
Our side, sir.


COLONEL
Don't you love your country?

      JOKER
Yes,
sir.

      COLONEL
Then how about getting with the program?

Why don't you jump on the team and come
on in for the big win?


JOKER
Yes, sir!

      COLONEL
Son, all I've ever asked
of my marines is that
they obey my orders as they would the word

of God. We are here to help the Vietnamese,
because inside every
gook there is an
American trying to get out. It's a hardball

world, son. We've gotta keep our heads until

of my shit!

Loud laughs and shouts.

      ANIMAL MOTHER

(moves in close)
You talk the talk. Do you walk the walk?


Anticipatory adlibs of "Ooooh!" and "Whoooa!"

EIGHTBALL, a black
grunt, gets up and steps between
JOKER and ANIMAL MOTHER.


EIGHTBALL
      (to JOKER)
Now you might not believe it but
under fire
Animal Mother is one of the finest human
beings in
the world.

Laughter.

      EIGHTBALL
All he needs is
somebody to throw hand
grenades at him the rest of his life.


Laughter.

EIGHTBALL leads ANIMAL MOTHER away.

      COWBOY

(laughing)
Come on, sit down. Come on, new guy.

EIGHTBALL and
ANIMAL MOTHER sit down together.

      ANIMAL MOTHER
Hey,
jungle bunny. Thank God for the sickle
cell, huh?


EIGHTBALL
Yeah, mother.

CRAZY EARL sits on the ground next to a
figure
sprawled in a chair.

      CRAZY EARL
Hey ...
photographer! You want to take a
good picture? Here, man ... take
this. This
... is my bro.

CRAZY EARL lifts the hat which has
been, covering
the man's face. We see he is a dead N.V.A. soldier.


Laughter.

      CRAZY EARL
This is his party. He's the guest
of honor.
Today ... is his birthday.

Adlibs: "Happy Birthday,
zipperhead!" etc.

      CRAZY EARL
I will never forget this
day. The day I came
to Hue City and fought one million N.V.A.

gooks. I love the little Commie bastards, man,
I really do. These
enemy grunts are as hard
as slant-eyed drill instructors. These are

great days we're living, bros!'We are jolly
green giants, walking
the earth with guns.
These people we wasted here today ... are

the finest human beings we will ever know.
After we rotate back to
the world, we're gonna
miss not having anyone around that's worth

shooting.

69 EXT. A FIELD, OUTSKIRTS HUE CITY--DAY

COWBOY's platoon,
advancing towards the city in a
sweep formation behind tanks.

Cuts
of the squad, nervous and alert.

Mortar rounds explode ahead.


LIEUTENANT TOUCHDOWN is hit and goes down.

The platoon dives for
cover.

DOC JAY crawls to him and starts mouth-to-mouth.

SERGEANT
MURPHY crawls up, has a look, moves to
the back of the tank and picks
up a field radio.

The platoon stays flat.

      MURPHY

Delta Six Actual, this is Murphy. Over. Delta
Six Actual, this is
Murphy. Over.

      DELTA SIX
      (o.s.)
Delta Six.


MURPHY
Delta Six, we are receiving incoming fire from
the
ville. The Lieutenant is down. We're going
to stop here and check
out what's in front of
us. Over.

CRAZY EARL, keeping low,
scrambles up to the
LUSTHOG SQUAD.

      CRAZY EARL
Okay.
Lusthog Squad, listen up! We're gonna
move up these two roads here
and check the
ville. I want the third team up this road here.

First and second fire team behind me up this
other road, okay?


Adlibs of "Right!" and "Okay!"

      CRAZY EARL
Let's go!
Let's get it done!

Bending low the squad moves out past the tanks,

leapfrogging toward some ruined buildings a couple
of hundred yards in
front of them.

HAND JOB peers cautiously around the corner of a

house and is killed instantly by a burst of
automatic fire.

ANIMAL
MOTHER opens fire with his M-60 machine
gun at some windows where the
shots came from.

Everyone opens fire, blasting chunks out of the

building with a zillion rounds.

T.H.E. ROCK fires an M-79 grenade,
blowing out a
window.

RAFTERMAN photographs the action, his Nikon

violently shaking.

The fire slackens.

Then it gets quiet.

All
their senses alert, everyone watches the
building, listening hard.


They reload.

As CRAZY EARL reloads he spots six V.C. dashing
across
the street fifty yards away. They are out of
sight in a second.


Having missed his first chance, CRAZY EARL gets
set hoping for another.


Two more V.C. rush out into the open. He fires a
long burst from his
M-16 and they both go down.

CRAZY EARL turns to the squad with a big
grin.

Music: "Surfin' Bird" by the Trashmen. This car-
ries over
through the next scene.


70 EXT. LOW WALL--DAY

The platoon are
hunched down behind a low wall.
Tanks fire at some distant buildings. A
three-man
TV crew, ducking low, moves past them, filming.


JOKER
      (John Wayne voice)
Is that you, John Wayne? Is
this me?

      COWBOY
Hey, start the cameras. This is
"Vietnam--
the Movie!"

      EIGHTBALL
Yeah, Joker can
be John Wayne. I'll be a
horse!

      DONLON
T.H.E. Rock
can be a rock!

      T.H.E. ROCK
I'll be Ann-Margret!


DOC JAY
Animal Mother can be a rabid buffalo!

      CRAZY
EARL
I'll be General Custer!

      RAFTERMAN
Well,
who'll be the Indians?

      ANIMAL MOTHER
Hey, we'll let the
gooks play the Indians!

Laughter.


71 EXT. HUE CITY RUINS--DAY


The bodies of LIEUTENANT TOUCHDOWN and HAND
JOB laid out on ground
sheets. The LUSTHOG SQUAD
are gathered around them. The camera moves to

each man, pausing for them to speak.

      T.H.E. ROCK
You're
going home now.

Camera move.

      CRAZY EARL
Semper fi.


Camera move.

      DONLON
We're mean marines, sir.

Camera
move.

      EIGHTBALL
Go easy, bros.

Camera move.


ANIMAL MOTHER
Better you than me.

      RAFTERMAN
Well,
at least they died for a good cause.

      ANIMAL MOTHER
What
cause was that?

      RAFTERMAN
Freedom.

      ANIMAL
MOTHER
Flush out your head gear, new guy. You think
we waste
gooks for freedom? This is a
slaughter. If I'm gonna get my balls
blown off
for a word ... my word is "poontang."

      COWBOY

Tough break for Hand Job. He was all set to
get shipped out on a
medical.

      JOKER
What was the matter with him?


COWBOY
He was jerkin' off ten times a day.

      EIGHTBALL

It's no shit. At least ten times a day.

      COWBOY
Last
week he was sent down to Da Nang to
see the Navy head shrinker, and
the crazy
fucker starts jerking off in the waiting room.

Instant Section Eight. He was just waiting for
his papers to clear
division.


72 EXT. HUE CITY--VARIOUS PLACES--DAY

The television crew
interviews members of the
LUSTHOG SQUAD.

      REPORTER
You
ready?

      CAMERAMAN
Yeah.

      REPORTER

Turnover.

      CAMERAMAN
Rolling.

      REPORTER

Hue City interviews. Roll thirty-four.

      ANIMAL MOTHER

Well ... like, like you see, you know, it's a
major city, so we have
to assault with, uh ...
tanks. So, they send us in first squad ...
to
make sure that there are no little Vietnamese
waiting with,
like, B-40 rockets that blow the
tanks away. So we clear it out and
we roll the
tanks in and ... basically, blow the place to
hell.

(chuckles)

      COWBOY
When we're in Hue ... when we're in
Hue City
... it's like a war. You know like what I
thought
about a war, what I thought a war
was, was supposed to be. There's
the enemy,
kill 'em.

      RAFTERMAN
Well, I don't think
there's any question about
it. I mean we're the best. I mean all
that
bullshit about the Air Cav ... When the shit
really hits
the fan, who do they call? They call
Mother Green and her killing
machine!

      CRAZY EARL
Do I think America belongs in
Vietnam? Um
... I don't know. I belong in Vietnam. I'll tell

you that.

      DOC JAY
Can I quote L.B.J.?


REPORTER
Sure.

      DOC JAY
      (imitating L.B.J.)

"I will not send American boys eight or ten
thousand miles around
the world to do a job
that Asian boys oughtta be doin' for

themselves."

      EIGHTBALL
Personally, I think, uh ... they
don't really
want to be involved in this war. I mean ...
they
sort of took away our freedom and gave it
to the, to the gookers,
you know. But they
don't want it. They'd rather be alive than free,

I guess. Poor dumb bastards.

      COWBOY
Well, the ones I'm
... I'm fighting at are some
pretty bad boys. I'm not real keen on
... some
of these fellows that are . . . supposed to be on
our
side. I keep meeting'em coming the other
way. Yeah.


DONLON
I mean, we're getting killed for these people
and they
don't even appreciate it. They think
it's a big joke.


ANIMAL MOTHER
Well, if you ask me, uh, we're shooting the
wrong
gooks.

      RAFTERMAN
Well, it depends on the situation. I
mean,
I'm--I'm here to take combat photos. But if
the shit gets
too thick, I mean, I'll go to the
rifle.

      ANIMAL MOTHER

What do I think about America's involvement
in the war? Well, I
think we should win.

      COWBOY
I hate Vietnam. There's not
one horse in this
whole country. They don't have one horse in

Vietnam. There's something basically wrong
with that.

(laughs)

      ANIMAL MOTHER
Well, if they'd send us more
guys and maybe
bomb the hell out of the North, they might,
uh,
they might give up.

      JOKER
I wanted to see exotic
Vietnam, the jewel of

Southeast Asia. I wanted to meet interesting

and stimulating people of an ancient culture
and ... kill them. I
wanted to be the first kid
on my block to get a confirmed kill.


73
EXT. WRECKED MOVIE THEATER--DAY

The marines are seated outside the
theater on rows
of broken movie seats.

A motor-scooter, driven by a
young ARVN soldier
with a pretty teenage Vietnamese HOOKER sitting

behind him, and pulls up in front of the LUSTHOG
SQUAD.

The girl
gets off slowly, swinging her hips as she
walks.

Adlibs, hoots anal
hollers.

      COWBOY
Ten-hut!

More hoots and hollers.


COWBOY
Good morning, little schoolgirl. I'm a little
schoolboy,
too.

Adlibs and laughter.

      COWBOY
What you got there,
chief!

The girl stands facing them, hands on hips.

      ARVN
PIMP
Do you want number one fuckee?

Adlibs and laughter.


COWBOY
Hey, any of you boys want number one
fuckee?

Adlibs.


JOKER
Oh, I'm so horny. I can't even get a piece of
hand.


DONLON
Hey! Hey! Me want suckee.

      ARVN PIMP
Suckee,

Laughter.

      COWBOY

      ARVN PIMP

Fifteen dolla each.

Adlibs: "Nooooooo!"

      COWBOY

Number ten. Fifteen dolla beaucoup money.

Laughter.


COWBOY
Five dolla each.

      ARVN PIMP
Come on. She
love you good. Boom-boom long
time. Ten dolla.

      COWBOY

Five dolla.

      ARVN PIMP
No. Ten dolla.


COWBOY
Be glad to trade you some ARVN rifles. Never
been fired
and only dropped once.

Laughter and derisive adlibs.

      ARVN
PIMP
      (angry)
Okay, five dolla. You give me.

Adlibs.


COWBOY
Okay, okay!

EIGHTBALL, a black grunt, walks up to the
girl.

      EIGHTBALL
Let's get mounted.

      HOOKER

(speaks in Vietnamese)

      ARVN PIMP
      (argues in
Vietnamese)

      EIGHTBALL
Something wrong there, chief?


ARVN PIMP
She says, uh, no boom-boom with soul
brotha.


EIGHTBALL
Hey, what the mother fuck?

      ARVN PIMP
She
say soul brotha too boo-coo. Too boo-coo.

      EIGHTBALL

Hey, what is this, man?

      COWBOY
      (breaiting up)

I think what he's trying to tell you is that
you black boys pack too
much meat.

Laughter.

      ARVN PIMP
Too boo-coo. Too
boo-coo.

      EIGHTBALL
Oh, shi-i-i-t! (laughs) This
baby-san looks
like she could suck the chrome off a trailer

hitch.

Laughter.

      ARVN PIMP
She say too boo-coo. Too
boo-coo.

      EIGHTBALL
Uh, excuse me, ma'am. Now what we
have
here, little yellow sister, is a magnificent...

(takes out his dick)
. . specimen of pure Alabama blacksnake.

But it ain't too goddamn boo-coo.

The girl looks at it.

Hoots and
catcalls.

      TEENAGE HOOKER
Okay. Okay. Emjee.

More
hoots.

      COWBOY
      (mimicking Vietnamese word)

Okay! Okay! Emjee! Emjee!

Adlibs of "Emjee."

EIGHTBALL starts to
lead her away.

      EIGHTBALL
All right! This is my boogie!


COWBOY
Hey, we need a batting order.

ANIMAL MOTHER grabs the
girl's arm, EIGHTBALL
holds on to the other one.

      ANIMAL
MOTHER
I'm going first.

      EIGHTBALL
Hey, now back
off, white bread. Don't get
between a dog and his meat.

ANIMAL
MOTHER slaps EIGHTBALL on the wrist like
he's a naughty boy and pushes
the girl into the
movie theater.

      ANIMAL MOTHER

(jokingly)
All fucking niggers must fucking hang.

Adlibs of "Fuck
you!" and laughter.

      ANIMAL MOTHER
Hey, hey! I won't be
long. I'll skip the
foreplay.

FADE IN:


74 EXT. HUE CITY
RUINS--DAY

The LUSTHOG SQUAD on patrol moves slowly in
single file,
fifteen yards apart, through the ruined,
smouldering city.


JOKER
      (voiceouer)
Intelligence passed the word down that
during
the night the N.V.A. had pulled out of our
area to
positions across the Perfume River.
Our squad is sent on patrol to
check out the
report.

75 INT. BOMBED FACTORY--DAY

The patrol
moves carefully through the gutted shell
of a building. The clink of
their gear as they walk
sounds loud in the unnatural silence.

CRAZY
EARL stops to pick up a child's stuffed toy.

BANG!

The toy triggs a
booby trap, blasting CRAZY EARL
across the room.

The squad dives for
couer.

      COWBOY
Face outboard and take cover! Do it!


DOC JAY scurries up to CRAZY EARL, who is
unconscious and gives him
mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation.

COWBOY scrambles up to them. He looks
at CRAZY
EARL. Then JOKER runs in.

      DOC JAY

(stops for a second)
He aidt gonna make it.

      COWBOY

(to himself)
Shit.

COWBOY doesn't know, what to do. Then he
fumbles
for his field radio.

      COWBOY
Hotel One Actual,
this is Cowboy!

DOC JAY continues the mouth-to-mouth.


COWBOY
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy!

      MURPHY

(o.s.)
Hotel One. Over

      COWBOY
Murph, this is
Cowboy. Craze is hit. Booby
trap.

      MURPHY

(o.s.)
Roger. Understand. Wait One.

COWBOY looks around edgily.


MURPHY
      (o.s.)
You're senior N.C.O. You take charge and

continue on with the patrol. Call in at the
next checkpoint. Over.


COWBOY
Roger. Out.

COWBOY stares at the radio. He looks scared.
He
turns to JOKER.

      COWBOY
I'm squad leader.

JOKER
punches him reassuringly in the arm.

      JOKER
I'll follow
you anywhere, scumbag.

DOC JAY stops working over CRAZY EARL and
slowly
looks up.

      DOC JAY
He's dead.

The three men
stare at the body.

76 EXT. BURNING FALLEN BUILDING--DAY

The squad
moves past a burning five-storey
building that has collapsed and is
lying on its side.


DISSOLVE TO:


77 EXT. LOW CONCRETE WALL--DAY


EIGHTBALL, on point, studies a map as he walks.
Then he slours to a
stop and signals to halt the
squad.

The squad stops ancl crouches
down in the rubble.

EIGHTBALL gestures for COWBOY to move up.


EIGHTBALL
      (quietly)
Cowboy!

COWBOY moves up and they
kneel behind a low
concrete wall.

      COWBOY
What's up?


EIGHTBALL
I think we made a mistake at the last
checkpoint.


He shows COWBOY the map.

      EIGHTBALL
Here ... see what
you think. I think we're
here and we should be here.

COWBOY
studies the map.

      COWBOY
We're here?


EIGHTBALL
Yeah.

      COWBOY
We should be here?


EIGHTBALL
Yeah ...yeah ... that's right.

COWBOY is confused and
scared.

He checks his compass. Then he peers over the wall
through
his binoculars.

COWBOY looks back nervously at the squacl strung
out
behind him.

      COWBOY
Fuck ... What do you think?


EIGHTBALL
Well, I think we should change direction.

EIGHTBALL
doesn't sound like he really knows what
to do either.

COWBOY knows
he has to make a decision.

      COWBOY
Okay. We'll change
direction.

COWBOY motions to the squad to come up. They
rattle up
and take positions behind the low wall.

      JOKER
What's
up?

      COWBOY
Changing direction.

      JOKER

What, are we lost?

      COWBOY
Joker, shut the fuck up!


COWBOY
      (to squad)
Okay! Listen up! Can you hear me?


Adlibs of "Yeah!"

      COWBOY
Okay, we're changing
direction. We're heading
over that way.

COWBOY points over the
wall to some ruined
buildings across an open space to their Left.


COWBOY
Eightball's gonna go out and see if he can
find a way
through.

EIGHTBALL shrugs, apprehensiuely.

      COWBOY

Got it?

Adlibs of "Yeah!"

      COWBOY
Eightball ... let's
dance.

EIGHTBALL slowly gets to his Knees and peers
over the wall.


EIGHTBALL
Put a nigger behind the trigger.


78 EXT. RUINED STREET
HUE--DAY

EIGHTBALL climbs over the low wall and moves
cautiously out
into the open, heading for the
damaged buildings.

The squad covers
him.

EIGHTBALL reaches the buildings and stops to
study the
smoke-filled square.


79 SNIPER P.O.V. -- DAY

P.O.V. from a concealed
position on the second
floor of a building on the square, an AK-47
rifle is
slowly raised and aimed at EIGHTBALL.

EIGHTBALL turns back
to wave the rest of the
squad up.

BANG!

The SNIPER fires.


EIGHTBALL is hit in the leg.

Seen in slow motion, EIGHTBALL twists and

crumples to the ground.

The LUSTHOG SQUAD fires blindly, wildly, at
every
door and window in the direction of the shot.

      COWBOY

Okay, cease fire! Cease fire, goddamn it!

Some of the squad keep
firing.

      COWBOY
Cool it, goddamn it! Cool it! Cease
fire!

AdLibs of "Cease fire!"

The firing stutters to a stop.


COWBOY
Okay, listen up! Did anybody see a sniper?
Did anybody
see anything?

      T.H.E. ROCK
      (down the line)

Did anybody see a sniper?

      DOC JAY
No!


DONLON
Nothing!

      RAFTERMAN
Negative!


T.H.E. ROCK
Nothing!

Adlibs of "No!"

      COWBOY

Okay, then save your ammo! Nobody fire till I
tell you!

Seen, in
slow, motion, the SNIPER fires again and hits
EIGHTBALL in the arm. He
screams in pain.

The squad opens fire at buildings facing them.


COWBOY
No, no! Cease fire! Cease fire! Animal, cease
fire!


Keeping low, DONLON comes up and hands COWBOY
the radio.


DONLON
Cowboy, it's Sergeant Murphy.

      COWBOY

(into radio)
This is Cowboy. Over.

      MURPHY

(o.s.)
This is Murphy. What is your present
position? Over.


COWBOY
Murph, we're receiving enemy sniper fire.
Eightball is
down. Our position is about half
a klick north of checkpoint four.
Believe pos-
sible strong enemy force occupying buildings
in
front of us. Request immediate tank
support. Over.


MURPHY
      (o.s.)
Roger. Understand. I'll see what I can do.

Over.

      COWBOY
Roger. Over and out.

      COWBOY

(to Donlon)
Stay close.

      DONLON
Got it.

COWBOY
thinks hard for a few seconds.

      COWBOY
      (to squad)

Okay, listen up! I think we're being set up
for an ambush. I think
there may be strong
enemy forces in those buildings over there.

I've requested tank support. We're gonna sit
tight until it comes,
but keep your eyes open.
If they decide to hit us, we'll have to
pull
back fast.

The SNIPER fires, wounding EIGHTBALL again, this

time in the foot. He shrieks in agony.

Again the squad opens fire.


COWBOY
Goddamn it! Hold! Cease your fire, Mother!
Cease your
fucking fire!

The firing stops.

      DOC JAY
Cowboy!


COWBOY
What?

      DOC JAY
We can't leave him out there!


COWBOY
We're not leaving him! We'll get him when the
tank comes
up.

      DOC JAY
He's hit three fucking times! He can't wait

that long!

      COWBOY
I've seen this before! That sniper's
just trying
to suck us in one at a time!

The SNIPER fires and
hits EIGHTBALL in the thigh.
His cries echo across the open space
ground.

ANIMAL MOTHER fires madly.

      COWBOY

(shouting)
Goddamn it! No!

The squad continues firing.


COWBOY
Goddamn it, cease fire!

The firing trails off:


ANIMAL MOTHER
He's out there alone!

      COWBOY
Cease
fire!

The firing stops.

      DOC JAY
Man, fuck this, fuck
this shit! I'm going out to
bring him in!

      COWBOY

No! You stay the fuck down!

      DOC JAY
Cover me!

DOC
JAY jumps over the wall and, ducking low, zig-
zags across the open
ground.

The squad fires to cover him.

DOC JAY gets there safely and
momentarily drops out
of sight.

      COWBOY
Goddamn it!
Goddamn it! Okay, cease fire!
He's there!

Adlibs of "Cease fire!"



80 SNIPER P.O.V.--DAY

DOC JAY, Seen over the sights of the SNIPER's
AK-47,
drags EIGHTBALL toward cover.


81 EXT. THE SQUARE--DAY

The
SNIPER fires. DOC JAY is hit and falls next to
EIGHTBALL.

The squad
opens fire again.

      COWBOY
Hold your fire! Hold your
fire!!! Cease fire!
You can't see the sniper! Save the ammo!

Nobody fire till I tell you! Nobody!

      ANIMAL MOTHER
What
the fuck do we do now, Cowboy?

      COWBOY
Gimme that
fucking radio.

DONLON scuttles over with the radio.


COWBOY
      (into radio)
Murph? This is Cowboy. Over.


MURPHY
      (o.s.)
This is Murphy. Over.

      COWBOY

Murph, we're in some deep shit. I got two men
down. What's the story
on that fucking tank?
Over.

      MURPHY
      (o.s.)

Sorry, Cowboy. No luck so far with the tank.
Will advise. Over.


COWBOY
Roger. Out.
      (muttering to himself)
Numbnut
bastards!
      (to the squad)
Okay, listen up!


T.H.E. ROCK
Listen up!

      COWBOY
Can't afford to wait
for the tank. I think
they're gonna hit us any minute. When they

do we won't have time to pull out. We gotta do
it now. Let's get
ready to move.

No one moves or says anything.

      T.H.E. ROCK

Get ready to pull out!

      ANIMAL MOTHER
Wait a minute!
Hold it! Hold it! Nobody's
pulling out! There's only one fucking
sniper
out there!

      COWBOY
Back off, Mother! I'm
calling the plays! I say
we're pulling out!

      ANIMAL
MOTHER
Yeah, well, what about Doc Jay and Eightball?


COWBOY
I know it's a shitty thing to do, but we can't
refuse to
accept the situation.

      ANIMAL MOTHER
Yeah, well, we're
not leaving Doc Jay and
Eightball out there!

      COWBOY

Doc Jay and Eightball are wasted! You know
that!

      ANIMAL
MOTHER
Bullshit! Come on, you guys! We gotta go
bring'em back!
Let's go get 'em! Let's do it!

      COWBOY
Stand down,
Mother! That's a direct order!

      ANIMAL MOTHER
Fuck you,
Cowboy! Fuck all you assholes!

ANIMAL MOTHER jumps over the wall and
runs
screaming and firing his M-60.

The squad fires to cover him,
blasting chunks of
mortar and concrete from the buildings.


ANIMAL MOTHER
      (screaming)
Fucking son-of-a-bitch! You
motherfucker!
Aaagh! Whooo!

ANIMAL MOTHER reaches the buildings
and drops
down against a shattered wall. He calls across the
open
street.

      ANIMAL MOTHER
Doc! Doc! Doc! Where's the
sniper?

DOC JAY tries to speak.

      ANIMAL MOTHER
Doc,
where's the sniper?

Barely able to move, DOC JAY tries to point in the

direction of the SNIPER.

Suddenly he and EIGHTBALL are riddled by a
burst
of automatic fire from the SNIPER, Killing them
instantly.


ANIMAL MOTHER's eyes widen in horror.

      ANIMAL MOTHER

(under his breath)
Shit!

ANIMAL MOTHER gets to his feet and edges
forward to
the corner of the building.

He carefully looks around the
corner across the
square at the black building, from where he thinks

the shots were fired.

BANG!

A shot from the SNIPER ricochets off
the wall a few
inches from his head.

He ducks back around the
corner, breathing hard.

ANIMAL MOTHER looks around and carefully works

his way to a safer spot behind another building.

He shouts to the
squad.

      ANIMAL MOTHER
Hey, Cowboy!

      COWBOY

Yeah!

      ANIMAL MOTHER
Doc Jay and Eightball are wasted!
There's
only one sniper, nothing else. Move up the
squad!
You're clear up to here! Come on!

COWBOY isn't sure what to do.


COWBOY
      (mutters)
Son-of-a-bitch.

The squad look to
him.

He takes a couple of thoughtful breaths and decides
to go.


COWBOY
Okay, listen up!

No-Doze, Stutten, Donlon, Rock--you
come
with me, we'll take a look! The rest of you

stay put and
cover our ass! We may be
coming back in a big hurry!


JOKER
I'm going with you.

      RAFTERMAN
I'm coming,
too.

      COWBOY
Okay.
      (To the others)
You
all set?

Adlibs "Yeah!"

      COWBOY
Let's move out!


T.H.E. ROCK
Let's do it!

The five men clamber over the wall and
dash
across the broken ground to the smouldering
cluster of
buildings.

When they reach ANIMAL MOTHER he leads them
to a street
off the square where they duck down
against a shattered building.


They catch their breath and move forward to the
next building, where
they crouch down against
the wall.

      ANIMAL MOTHER

(pointing)
Cowboy .. . top of the black building,
around the
corner.

COWBOY cautiously moves to the corner of the
building and
studies the strange-looking black
building which commands the square.


Then. he ducks back around the corner, more
uncertain than ever what
they should do.

      COWBOY
Donlon ... give me that radio.


COWBOY moves to DONLON to take the radio.
Facing away from the black
building, COWBOY does
not notice that from the place he has moved to he

can be seen. by the SNIPER through a jagged hole in
the building.

83
SNIPER P.O.V. OF COWBOY

The SNIPER's P.O.V. --COWBOY's upper body is
just
visible through the hole in the building.


84 EXT. SQUARE--DUSK



COWBOY
Murphy, this is Cowboy. Over!

A gunshot reverberates.


In slow-motion COWBOY falls.

      JOKER
Cowboy!

ANIMAL
MOTHER starts firing his M-60.

      RAFTERMAN

(shouting)
Holy shit! The sniper's got a clean shot
through the
hole in the wall.

Much yelling, shouting and confusion as the men

realize where the shot came from.

      JOKER

(shouting)
Get him! Get him the fuck outta here!!

COWBOY is
carried behind the building.

All talk at once.

      JOKER

Easy! Easy!

      DONLON
Get him on his back.

Adlibs.


COWBOY
      (weakly)
Oh, I don't believe this shit.


Adlibs, fumbling for bandages, etc.

      JOKER
Shut up!
You'll be all right, Cowboy.

      T.H.E. ROCK
Take it easy,
Cowboy.

Four pairs of hands doing things.

      COWBOY

(moaning)
Uhhh, that son-of-a-bitch!

      JOKER
You're
gonna be all right.

      T.H.E. ROCK
You're going home, man.
You're going home.

      DONLON
Easy, man. Easy. Easy.


COWBOY
Ohhhh, don't shit me, JOKER! Don't shit me!


JOKER
I wouldn't shit you, man. You're my favorite
turd.


COWBOY begins to lose consciousness.

      JOKER
Cowboy...


DONLON
Hang on, man. Hang on!

      COWBOY

(coughs)
I ... I can hack it.

      T.H.E. ROCK
You can
hack it.

      COWBOY
I can. I-I...

COWBOY spits up some
blood and dies in JOKER's
arms.

JOKER bends down and hugs COWBOY.


Nobody moves.

Then, one by one, they slowly get to their feet.
JOKER
is the last to get up.

They stand looking at the body.

ANIMAL
MOTHER leaves two men to continue firing
at the SNIPER, and he scuttles
around the corner to
the group around COWBOY's body.

He looks at
COWBOY and then at JOKER.

      ANIMAL MOTHER
Let's go get
some payback.

JOKER looks up slowly.

      JOKER

(in cold anger)
Okay.

ANIMAL MOTHER leads then down a narrow
street.

They stop to take cover behind a building just off
the
square.

They have to cross the open. square, ruhich would
give the
SNIPER a clear shot at them.

      ANIMAL MOTHER
Give 'em
some smoke.

He and JOKER toss three smoke grenades into the
square.
They explode ruith a dull bang.

They wait while the square slowly
fills with
smoke.

ANIMAL MOTHER waves and they run out blindly

through the thick smoke to the other side of the
square.

85 INT. BLACK
BUILDING

They work their way into the shattered, burning
building,
past twisted steel girders and huge broken
chunks of concrete.

They
come to a place where they have to split up.
ANIMAL MOTHER points one
way.

      ANIMAL MOTHER
Donlon, Rock--that way. You two with
me.

DONLON and T.H.E. ROCK move off as ordered.

JOKER and RAFTERMAN
follow ANIMAL MOTHER the
other way.

They come to another place where
they have to
choose which way to go.

      ANIMAL MOTHER

(pointing)
JOKER, in there! New Guy with me.

JOKER cautiously
enters one door. ANIMAL MOTHER
and RAFTERMAN disappear through the
other.


86 INT. WRECKED AND BURNING LOBBY--DAY

JOKER finds himself in
what was the lobby of the
building, a large room, which is on fire,
with
shattered columns, oriental arches, and windows
with large
decorative grillwork.

JOKER inches slowly into the room.

He hears a
noise, ducks behind a column and peers
around it.

He sees a small, b lack-clad figure standing at a
window - the SNIPER.

He raises his
rifle, aims and squeezes the trigger.

A loud click.

In slow motion
the SNIPER turns to face JOKER.

We see the startled face of a
beautiful Vietnamese
girl of about fifteen.

In slow motion JOKER
frantically works the bolt of
his M-16.

With the hard eyes of a
grunt, the SNIPER fires her
AK-47 rifle.

In slow motion JOKER ducks
behind the column,
desperately trying to unjam his M-16 rifle.

In,
slow motion the SNIPER fires and runs down a
few steps to get a better
shot at JOKER.

The bullets from her AK-47 tear large chunks of

masonry from the column shielding him.

Suddenly the SNIPER's body
seems to explode as she
is hit by a burst of automatic fire.


RAFTERMAN has come up and fires his M-16 into the
girl's body.

JOKER
stands trembling against the shattered
column.

RAFTERMAN snaps
another M-16 magazine into
place, gestures JOKER to stay put, and moves

forward like Supergrunt to check out the rest of the
room.

It's
clear.

He moves to the window, and shouts to the two men
in the
square.

      RAFTERMAN
We got the sniper!

The SNIPER lies
on the floor, writhing in pain.

JOKER and RAFTERMAN cautiously
approach her.

RAFTERMAN kicks away her AK-47.

The two men stare at
her in disbelief:

The SNIPER is a child, no more than fifteen years

old, a slender Eurasian. angel with dark beautiful
eyes.

They are
startled by a faint sound.

They dive for cover.

They listen.


ANIMAL MOTHER calls from behind cover at the other
end of the room.


ANIMAL MOTHER
Joker?

      JOKER
Yo.

      ANIMAL
MOTHER
What's up?

      JOKER
We got the sniper.


RAFTERMAN and JOKER circle around the SNIPER as
DONLON and T.H.E. ROCK
and ANIMAL MOTHER walk
up.

      RAFTERMAN
I saved JOKER's
ass. I got the sniper. I fucking
blew her away.

RAFTERMAN laughs
hysterically, and kisses his rifle.

      RAFTERMAN
Am I bad?
Am I a life-taker? Am I a heart-
breaker?

No one pays any
attention to RAFTERMAN.

The SNIPER gasps, whimpers.

DONLON stares
at her.

      DONLON
What's she saying?

      JOKER

(after a pause)
She's praying.

      T.H.E. ROCK
No more
boom-boom for this baby-san. There's
nothing we can do for her.
She's dead meat.

ANIMAL MOTHER stares down at the SNIPER.


ANIMAL MOTHER
Okay. Let's get the fuck outta here.


JOKER
What about her?

      ANIMAL MOTHER
Fuck her. Let
her rot.

The SNIPER prays in Vietnanese.

      JOKER
We
can't just leave her here.

      ANIMAL MOTHER
Hey, asshole
... Cowboy's wasted. You're
fresh out of friends. I'm running this
squad
now and I say we leave the gook for the
mother-lovin'
rats.

JOKER stares at ANIMAL MOTHER.

      JOKER
I'm not
trying to run this squad. I'm just
saying we can't leave her like
this.

ANIMAL MOTHER looks down at the SNIPER.

      SNIPER

(whimpering)
Sh . . . sh-shoot . . . me. Shoot . . . me.

ANIMAL
MOTHER looks at JOKER.

      ANIMAL MOTHER
If you want to
waste her, go on, waste her.

JOKER looks at the SNIPER.

The four
men look at JOKER.

      SNIPER
      (gasping)
Shoot .
. . me . . . shoot . . . me.

JOKER slowly lifts his pistol and looks
into her
eyes.

      SNIPER
Shoot . . . me.

JOKER jerks
the trigger.

BANG!

The four men are silent.

JOKER stares down at
the dead girl.

      RAFTERMAN
      (laughs)
JOKER ...
we're gonna have to put you up for
the Congressional Medal of...
Ugly!
      (laughs)

JOKER looks at RAFTERMAN, blankly.


DONLON
Hard core, man. Fucking hard core.


87 EXT. BURNING
CITY--NIGHT.

The platoon moves through the city, silhouetted
against
the raging fires. A scene in, hell.

      JOKER

(narration)
We have nailed our names in the pages of
history
enough for today. We hump down to
the Perfume River to set in for
the night.

The marines start to sing.
