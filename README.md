        /* comments out a big section */
    for html code:
        <!-- this is the only one -->
    for sql code, in a sql file: 
        /* this again */
    for java script:

Things to note!!
    So far, the register page, the confirm page, the approve page, 
    and probably some others have connection things to our databases, So I have
    both our stuff there, and when I am working on it, Ill just comment out your 
    database connection and have mine functioning, so lets do that from now on. 
    I'll list the line numbers for each page that specify your connect or mine, 
    so we know where to go exactly.

    I have no idea what fldApprove, fldLinkCheck, fldApproveCheck are. Can you
    update the schema for tblUsers, if you are adding fields, that way I can 
    update mine to work.
