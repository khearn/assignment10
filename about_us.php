        <p>You my be wondering how to beautiful girls came up with the ingenious idea of Random Task.  Well pull up a chair my friends and I will gladly tell you the tale.</p>
        <p>It was a dark and stormy night.  The kiddies were all out in costume giggling and running around in search of sweets and candies.  And up in the tallest tower of UVM, the the two beautiful ladies were looking down on the spectacle.</p>
        <p>The incredible display of chaos gave the ladies an incredible idea.  What if there was a better way for people to organize their lives.  They realized that they could create and give the kiddies and parents a treat like this with their Immaculate knowledge of web site database design.  They quickly, with haste set to work building their gift to the people of UVM. And they defiantly did not procrastinate!!!!!!!!!</p>
        <p>And now the gift of Random Task is complete for your use!</p>
